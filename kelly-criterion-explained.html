 <h1>Kelly Criterion Explained in Plain English</h1>
 <p class="meta">A jargon-free guide to the formula that changed how professionals bet</p>

 <p>If you have ever wondered how much you should bet on a game, you are not alone. Most bettors either pick a random amount or bet the same flat amount every time. But there is a mathematical answer to this question, and it has been around since 1956.</p>

 <p>The Kelly Criterion is a formula that tells you exactly what percentage of your bankroll to wager when you have an edge. It was invented by John Kelly, a scientist at Bell Labs who was trying to solve a completely unrelated problem involving telephone signals. He probably never imagined his formula would become the gold standard for <a href="bankroll-management.html">bankroll management</a> in sports betting, poker, and investing.</p>

 <h2>The Origin Story: John Kelly and Bell Labs</h2>

 <p>In 1956, a researcher named John Larry Kelly Jr. was working at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. Kelly wasn't a gambler. He was a physicist working on information theory, the branch of mathematics concerned with transmitting signals through noisy channels. His colleague Claude Shannon had recently published groundbreaking work on how much information could be sent through a telephone wire, and Kelly was extending those ideas.</p>

 <p>Kelly noticed something interesting. The math behind optimizing signal transmission was eerily similar to the math behind optimizing bets. If you think of a "noisy signal" as imperfect information about a sporting event, and you think of "channel capacity" as the maximum rate at which you can grow your bankroll, the same equations apply. His 1956 paper, "A New Interpretation of Information Rate," showed that a bettor with partial information about outcomes should wager a specific fraction of their wealth on each bet to maximize long-term growth.</p>

 <p>The paper didn't make a splash in the gambling world right away. It was an academic work published in the Bell System Technical Journal, read mostly by engineers and mathematicians. But over the following decades, professional gamblers and investors discovered Kelly's formula and realized it solved one of the most important problems in betting: how much to risk when you have an edge. Today, everyone from horse racing syndicates to hedge fund managers to sharp sports bettors uses some version of the Kelly Criterion to size their positions.</p>

 <h2>What Problem Does Kelly Solve?</h2>

 <p>Here is the fundamental question Kelly answers: If you have a genuine advantage on a bet, how much should you risk?</p>

 <p>Bet too little, and you leave money on the table. Your edge exists, but you are not capitalizing on it. Bet too much, and a few losses in a row could devastate your bankroll, even if you have a long-term edge.</p>

 <p>Kelly finds the sweet spot. It calculates the exact bet size that maximizes your long-term growth rate while never risking so much that you could go broke.</p>

 <h2>The Formula in Simple Terms</h2>

 <p>The Kelly formula looks intimidating at first, but it boils down to a simple idea:</p>

 <div class="highlight-box">
 <p><strong>Bet a percentage of your bankroll equal to your edge divided by the odds.</strong></p>
 </div>

 <p>Your "edge" is the difference between your estimated win probability and the break-even probability implied by the odds. If the sportsbook thinks a bet has a 50% chance of winning, but you believe it has a 55% chance, your edge is 5%.</p>

 <p>The formula then adjusts this edge based on the payout. Higher odds mean you can bet a smaller percentage. Lower odds mean you can bet more, if your edge is the same.</p>

 <h2>Breaking Down the Formula Variable by Variable</h2>

 <p>Let's get specific. The Kelly Criterion formula in its standard form looks like this:</p>

 <div class="highlight-box">
 <p><strong>f* = (bp - q) / b</strong></p>
 </div>

 <p>Where:</p>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>f*</strong> is the fraction of your bankroll to bet. This is the answer you are solving for. If f* comes out to 0.05, that means bet 5% of your bankroll.</li>
 <li><strong>b</strong> is the decimal odds minus 1, or the net payout you receive on a winning bet. If you bet $100 and win $200 total (your $100 back plus $100 profit), then b = 1. If you win $300 total, b = 2.</li>
 <li><strong>p</strong> is your estimated probability of winning the bet. This is the hard part, and it is where your skill as a handicapper matters. If you believe a team has a 60% chance of covering, p = 0.60.</li>
 <li><strong>q</strong> is the probability of losing, which is simply 1 minus p. If p = 0.60, then q = 0.40.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>The formula multiplies your win probability by the payout (bp), subtracts the probability of losing (q), and divides by the payout (b). The result is the mathematically optimal bet size. If the answer is zero or negative, the formula is telling you something important: you don't have an edge, and you shouldn't bet at all.</p>

 <h2>How to Convert American Odds for the Kelly Formula</h2>

 <p>Most American sportsbooks display odds in the format you are used to seeing: -110, +150, -200, and so on. The Kelly formula needs decimal odds, so you need to convert. Here is how.</p>

 <p>For <strong>negative American odds</strong> (favorites), divide the absolute value of the odds by 100. For example, -110 odds means you risk $110 to win $100, so b = 100/110 = 0.909. For -150, b = 100/150 = 0.667. For -200, b = 100/200 = 0.50.</p>

 <p>For <strong>positive American odds</strong> (underdogs), divide the odds by 100. So +150 means you win $150 on a $100 bet, giving you b = 150/100 = 1.50. For +200, b = 2.00. For +300, b = 3.00.</p>

 <p>Once you have b, plug it into the Kelly formula along with your estimated probability. If you want to skip the manual math, our <a href="kelly-criterion.html">Kelly Criterion calculator</a> handles the conversion automatically. Just enter your American odds and your estimated win probability, and it does the rest.</p>

 <div class="example-box">
 <h3>A Simple Example</h3>
 <p>Imagine you have a $1,000 bankroll. You find a bet at -110 odds (standard juice), and after doing your research, you believe you have a 55% chance of winning. The break-even at -110 is about 52.4%.</p>
 <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Your edge is 55% minus 52.4% = about 2.6%. The Kelly formula says to bet roughly 5.5% of your bankroll, or $55.</p>
 <p style="margin-top: 15px;">That number might seem small if you are used to betting $100 or $200 per game. But Kelly is playing the long game. Over hundreds of bets, this sizing optimizes your growth. You can find more worked scenarios like this in our <a href="kelly-criterion/examples.html">Kelly Criterion examples</a> page.</p>
 </div>

 <h2>Why Kelly Works</h2>

 <p>The genius of Kelly is that it automatically scales your bets based on two things: your edge and your bankroll.</p>

 <p>When you win, your bankroll grows, and Kelly tells you to bet more in absolute dollars. When you lose, your bankroll shrinks, and Kelly tells you to bet less. This prevents you from ever going completely broke, because you are always betting a percentage, not a fixed amount.</p>

 <p>At the same time, Kelly bets more when your edge is larger and less when your edge is smaller. This means you are putting more money on your best opportunities and less on marginal ones.</p>

 <h2>Why Kelly Maximizes Long-Term Wealth</h2>

 <p>Here is something that surprises a lot of people: Kelly does not maximize your expected profit on any single bet. It maximizes the expected logarithm of your wealth, which mathematically translates to the fastest possible long-term growth rate. This distinction matters more than you might think.</p>

 <p>Imagine two bettors, both with a 55% edge on -110 bets. Bettor A uses Kelly sizing (about 5.5% of bankroll per bet). Bettor B bets 25% of their bankroll every time because they want to "go big." After 100 bets, Bettor A's bankroll has grown steadily. Bettor B, despite having the same edge, has almost certainly gone broke or suffered a devastating drawdown. A string of five or six losses, which is completely normal even with a 55% win rate, wipes out most of Bettor B's bankroll.</p>

 <p>The mathematical insight is that maximizing log-wealth is equivalent to maximizing the geometric growth rate of your bankroll. Over many bets, geometric compounding dominates everything. A strategy that grows at 3% per bet will absolutely crush a strategy that grows at 5% per bet but occasionally drops 40%, because the recovery from those drops eats up all the extra growth and then some. Kelly finds the exact point where growth is maximized without risking catastrophic drawdowns.</p>

 <p>You can see this principle in action for yourself using our <a href="kelly-simulation.html">Kelly simulation tool</a>, which lets you run thousands of simulated bets at different Kelly fractions and watch how the bankroll trajectories diverge over time.</p>

 <h2>Who Should Use Kelly?</h2>

 <p>Kelly is ideal for:</p>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Bettors with a proven edge.</strong> If you have tracked hundreds of bets and know your actual win rate is above break-even, Kelly helps you size your bets optimally.</li>
 <li><strong>Long-term thinkers.</strong> Kelly is not about winning big tonight. It is about growing your bankroll steadily over months and years.</li>
 <li><strong>Disciplined bettors.</strong> Kelly requires you to trust the math, even when it tells you to bet less than you want to.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Who Should Not Use Kelly</h2>

 <p>Kelly is not for everyone:</p>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Recreational bettors.</strong> If you bet for entertainment and do not track results carefully, Kelly adds unnecessary complexity.</li>
 <li><strong>Bettors without data.</strong> Kelly requires you to estimate your win probability accurately. Without a track record, your estimates are guesses, and Kelly will mislead you.</li>
 <li><strong>Bettors who cannot estimate edges.</strong> If you cannot articulate why your probability differs from the implied odds, you probably do not have an edge.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Limitations and Assumptions You Need to Know</h2>

 <p>The Kelly Criterion is powerful, but it rests on several assumptions that do not perfectly hold in the real world of sports betting. Understanding these limitations is just as important as understanding the formula itself.</p>

 <p><strong>Assumption 1: You know your true edge.</strong> Kelly requires an accurate estimate of your win probability. If you think you win 58% of the time but you actually win 52%, Kelly will tell you to bet far too much. Overestimating your edge is the single most dangerous mistake a Kelly bettor can make, and it is incredibly common. Most bettors overrate their own skill. If you don't have a large sample of tracked bets to draw from, your probability estimates are unreliable. For a deeper dive into this and other pitfalls, check out our guide on <a href="kelly-criterion-mistakes.html">common Kelly Criterion mistakes</a>.</p>

 <p><strong>Assumption 2: Each bet is independent.</strong> The formula assumes that the outcome of one bet does not affect the outcome of the next. In practice, sports bettors often have correlated bets, like betting on multiple games in the same league on the same night. When bets are correlated, optimal sizing changes, and standard Kelly may overexpose you.</p>

 <p><strong>Assumption 3: You can bet any fractional amount.</strong> Kelly might tell you to bet 3.7% of your bankroll. If your bankroll is $500, that is $18.50. Some sportsbooks have minimum bets or only accept round numbers. These practical constraints mean you can rarely bet the exact Kelly amount, though rounding to the nearest dollar is close enough for most purposes.</p>

 <p><strong>Assumption 4: Odds are fixed and known.</strong> The formula uses a specific payout ratio. But in sports betting, odds shift constantly. The line you see when you run the Kelly calculation might not be the line you get when you place the bet. This is another reason to build in a margin of safety.</p>

 <h2>Fractional Kelly: The Practical Solution</h2>

 <p>Full Kelly betting assumes your edge estimate is perfectly accurate. In reality, nobody estimates edges perfectly. This is why most professionals use fractional Kelly, betting only 25% to 50% of what the formula recommends.</p>

 <p>Fractional Kelly gives you most of the growth benefit with much less volatility. It is a safety buffer against the inevitable errors in your probability estimates. The math is elegant here: half Kelly gives you 75% of the growth rate of full Kelly but with dramatically smoother results. Quarter Kelly gives you roughly half the growth rate but feels almost boring in terms of bankroll swings. For most sports bettors, especially those still building their track record, something in the range of 25% to 50% Kelly is the sweet spot.</p>

 <p>The choice between different Kelly fractions depends on your confidence in your edge estimates, your tolerance for bankroll swings, and how large your sample size is. If you have 2,000 tracked bets and a well-documented 54% win rate at -110, you can confidently use a higher Kelly fraction. If you have 100 bets and a 57% win rate that might just be a hot streak, dial it way down. We cover the tradeoffs in detail in our <a href="kelly-criterion/fractional-vs-full.html">fractional vs full Kelly comparison</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

 <p>The Kelly Criterion is one of the few betting strategies with real mathematical backing. It tells you exactly how much to bet when you have an edge, preventing both overbetting and underbetting. Born from information theory at Bell Labs in 1956, it has survived nearly seven decades of scrutiny from mathematicians, gamblers, and Wall Street traders alike. That kind of staying power says something.</p>

 <p>It is not magic. It will not help you if you do not actually have an edge. And it demands discipline, because the formula often recommends bet sizes that feel too small when you are confident and too large when you are nervous. But if you do have an edge, and you are playing the long game, Kelly is the optimal way to grow your bankroll over time. Pair it with solid <a href="bankroll-management.html">bankroll management principles</a> and a well-defined <a href="bankroll.html">unit system</a>, and you have the foundation that separates serious bettors from recreational ones.</p>

 <p>Start with the formula. Track your results. Use fractional Kelly until you trust your numbers. And let the math do the heavy lifting.</p>
