<h1>How It Works</h1>
</header>
<div class="content">
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 40px; padding: 30px; background-color: #222; border-left: 6px solid gold; border-radius: 10px; color: white; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.7;">
<strong style="color: gold; font-size: 24px;">Our Mission Was Simple:</strong><br/><br/>
  1. Build a model that wins. âœ…<br/>
  2. Bring integrity into a service field full of wannabes and jokers. âœ…<br/><br/>
  Weâ€™ve done both.<br/><br/>
  BetLegend is the <strong>only handicapping site in the world</strong> that is 100% transparent. Every single pick weâ€™ve ever made is logged publicly on the site. No deletions. No edits. No tricks. Just truth.<br/><br/>
  Donâ€™t believe it? Good. We invite you to check the site daily and see for yourself. Every pick is uploaded, timestamped, and even written up with a full blog post. Itâ€™s all there. Weâ€™re not hiding anything â€” and thatâ€™s exactly what sets us apart.
</div>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: gold;">
      Every single pick you see on our <a href="betlegend-verified-records.html" style="color: gold;">Verified Records</a> page has a full write-up in the <a href="blog.html" style="color: gold;">blog</a> section, complete with timestamp. We donâ€™t delete picks, fudge numbers, or hide results. Everything is model generated using advanced statistics. If you want proof, just keep coming back and see for yourself. Every bet is fully documented.

      BetLegend is built on data, backed by advanced statistical models that continuously evolve. We scrape the internet daily for up to date player stats, team trends, injury reports, bullpen usage, weather impact, and more. Using custom-built Python scripts and automated scrapers, we gather everything needed to make predictive decisions in real time.
    </p>
<p>
      But it doesnâ€™t stop there. Weâ€™ve run backtests on years of historical data to avoid bias and overfitting. Our model adjusts dynamically based on opponent quality, recent form, home and road splits, and even park factors. If a team crushes lefties or melts down in day games, our model catches it.
    </p>
<p>
      The result? A streamlined system that helps us find value edges before the market adjusts. Itâ€™s not magic. Itâ€™s not luck. Itâ€™s math. Welcome to BetLegend.
