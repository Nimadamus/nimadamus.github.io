      <tr>
        <td>Toronto @ Baltimore</td>
        <td>J. Berrios (R, 3.83) vs. D. Kremer (R, 4.18)</td>
        <td>A close divisional matchup where both pitchers have similar ERAs. Toronto has struggled on the road (26-29).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Arizona @ Detroit</td>
        <td>R. Nelson (R, 3.10) vs. Pitcher: TBD</td>
        <td>Nelson gives Arizona a solid arm, but Detroit is exceptional at home (35-21). Keep an eye out for the announced Tigers pitcher.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Boston @ Minnesota</td>
        <td>B. Bello (R, 3.31) vs. Z. Matthews (R, 4.97)</td>
        <td>Significant pitching advantage for Boston with Bello's strong ERA compared to Matthews'.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Washington @ Houston</td>
        <td>M. Gore (L, 3.54) vs. R. Gusto (R, 5.85)</td>
        <td>Washington has a clear edge on the mound. Gusto's high ERA makes Houston a risky favorite despite their strong home record.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Philadelphia @ Chi. White Sox</td>
        <td>T. Walker (R, 3.88) vs. A. Houser (R, 2.12)</td>
        <td>A surprising pitching mismatch favoring the White Sox. Houser's elite ERA could make the home underdog very live.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Atlanta @ Kansas City</td>
        <td>J. Wentz (L, 3.38) vs. A. Zerpa (L, 0.00)</td>
        <td>Zerpa's perfect ERA is an eye-opener for KC, who are 6-4 in their last 10 games. A potential upset spot against a struggling road team.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Chi. Cubs @ Milwaukee</td>
        <td>S. Imanaga (L, 3.12) vs. F. Peralta (R, 2.83)</td>
        <td>An elite pitching matchup between two aces. Peralta and the Brewers are dominant at home (36-19), giving them a slight edge.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pittsburgh @ San Francisco</td>
        <td>M. Burrows (R, 4.41) vs. L. Webb (R, 3.40)</td>
        <td>Clear advantage for the Giants with their ace Logan Webb on the mound, especially against a Pirates team that is just 15-37 on the road.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>NY Mets @ San Diego</td>
        <td>C. Holmes (R, 3.42) vs. Y. Darvish (R, 9.56)</td>
        <td>A massive red flag for the Padres. Darvish's astronomical 9.56 ERA presents a prime opportunity for the Mets.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Colorado @ Cleveland</td>
        <td>K. Freeland (L, 5.26) vs. K. Allard (L, 4.50)</td>
        <td>Both pitchers have high ERAs. Combined with Colorado's historically bad road record (14-41), this game has messy written all over it.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tampa Bay @ NY Yankees</td>
        <td>Z. Littell (R, 3.73) vs. W. Warren (R, 4.79)</td>
        <td>The pitching matchup favors Tampa Bay on the road. The Yankees are just 5-5 in their last 10 games.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>LA Dodgers @ Cincinnati</td>
        <td>S. Ohtani (R, 1.50) vs. N. Martinez (R, 4.81)</td>
        <td>A monumental pitching mismatch. Ohtani's elite Cy Young-caliber ERA makes the Dodgers a heavy favorite.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Miami @ St. Louis</td>
        <td>C. Quantrill (R, 5.09) vs. M. Mikolas (R, 4.94)</td>
        <td>Two struggling pitchers with high ERAs. This game could be ripe for runs, making the Over an interesting look.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Texas @ LA Angels</td>
        <td>N. Eovaldi (R, 1.50) vs. J. Soriano (R, 3.79)</td>
        <td>Huge advantage for Texas. Eovaldi's ace-level performance gives the Rangers a major edge on the mound.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Seattle @ Athletics</td>
        <td>B. Woo (R, 2.93) vs. J. Springs (L, 4.12)</td>
        <td>Seattle has the clear pitching advantage with Woo's excellent sub-3.00 ERA against a struggling Athletics team.</td>
