            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">San Francisco Giants @ Pittsburgh Pirates</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">The model identifies this as one of the cornerstone plays on the board, centered on a monumental pitching mismatch. Giants ace Logan Webb (3.32 ERA) is an elite groundball specialist whose profile is designed to neutralize offenses and produce deep, efficient outings. His sinker-slider combination has been devastating, and he faces a Pirates lineup that ranks in the bottom third of the league in wRC+ against right-handed pitching. In stark contrast, Pittsburgh's Matt Burrows (4.09 ERA) presents a significant step down in class. The algorithm flags Webb's dominance against a bottom-tier offense as a high-probability outcome, making the Giants ML and F5 -0.5 both strong, correlated plays.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">New York Yankees @ Texas Rangers</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This is another A-grade mismatch on the mound that the market has not fully priced in. Texas ace Nathan Eovaldi is having a Cy Young-caliber season, sporting a remarkable 1.49 ERA. His underlying metrics (low walk rate, high groundball rate, sub-3.00 FIP) fully support his elite performance. He's facing Will Warren, a rookie for the Yankees with a 4.62 ERA and peripherals that suggest he is vulnerable to power-hitting lineups like Texas. The Rangers are a dominant home team (35-20), and Eovaldi's presence amplifies that advantage. The model calculates a high probability of the Rangers securing an early lead and holding it, making both the ML and F5 ML strong investments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Kansas City Royals @ Boston Red Sox</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This play is a convergence of a massive pitching advantage and current team form. Boston sends out ace Garrett Crochet (2.23 ERA), whose elite strikeout numbers and minuscule WHIP have made him one of the most dominant left-handers in baseball. He faces a Royals team that is significantly outclassed. The Red Sox offense is firing on all cylinders, going 8-2 in their last 10 games, and they have been a juggernaut at Fenway Park (38-21). With every analytical category favoring Boston, the model indicates a high probability of a multi-run victory, making the -1.5 run line the superior value play over the heavily juiced moneyline.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Milwaukee Brewers @ Atlanta Braves</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This is a classic fade of a team in a deep slump. The Braves are just 3-7 in their last 10 games and have been a major disappointment at home (26-27). We are backing a superior team in Milwaukee (68-44) with a significant pitching advantage. Brewers ace Freddy Peralta (3.10 ERA) has been lights out, while the Braves counter with the very hittable Joey Wentz (1.80 ERA, but with a FIP suggesting major regression is due). The Brewers have also been one of the best road teams in baseball (32-24). The model identifies clear value on the better team with the better pitcher against a struggling opponent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Toronto Blue Jays @ Colorado Rockies</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">An auto-play on environmental factors. A game at Coors Field with a total of 11.5 is already enticing, but the pitching matchup makes it a near lock for offense. While José Berríos is a solid arm for Toronto, his career ERA at Coors is over 5.00, as the thin air diminishes the break on his pitches. The Rockies are starting an unproven rookie in Angel Molina, setting up the potent Blue Jays lineup for a massive day. With two capable offenses in the best hitter's park in sports, the over is a strong play.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Chicago White Sox @ Seattle Mariners</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This projects as a classic pitcher's duel in a pitcher-friendly park. Seattle's Bryan Woo has been excellent, with a 3.11 ERA and superb command that plays perfectly at T-Mobile Park. He faces a White Sox offense that is anemic on the road. The White Sox counter with Davis Martin, a serviceable arm who should be able to hold his own against a Mariners offense that is inconsistent and prone to cold spells. The model projects a low-scoring, clean game where runs are at a premium, making the Under 8 a strong value despite the juice.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Cincinnati Reds @ Chi. Cubs</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This matchup features an elite pitcher in a hostile environment, creating a high-variance situation. Cubs ace Shota Imanaga (3.25 ERA) has been brilliant, especially at Wrigley Field where the Cubs are 35-21. However, the Reds have been swinging hot bats (6-4 L10) and have performed well on the road against the spread. The Cubs have also been in a funk (5-5 L10). With the Cubs' home-field advantage clashing with their recent form and Imanaga's dominance, the model finds no clear edge and advises a pass.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">St. Louis Cardinals @ LA Dodgers</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">The Dodgers are heavy home favorites (-185) for a reason, with a strong home record (35-22) and the better team on paper. However, the pitching matchup between Miles Mikolas (4.83 ERA) and Emmet Sheehan (4.76 ERA) is essentially a wash. The most powerful trend here is the Dodgers' historic 0-9-1 run to the Under in their last 10 games. The model identifies this as the strongest angle, but a total of 9.0 is sharp. With no value on the side and a sharp total, this becomes a stay-away.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Minnesota Twins @ Detroit Tigers</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">The model identifies a significant home/road split that favors Detroit heavily. The Tigers have been a powerhouse at home (37-21), while the Twins have been one of the league's worst road teams (22-36). The pitching matchup, with Detroit's Chris Paddack (4.77 ERA) facing Minnesota's Zander Matthews (5.73 ERA), gives a slight edge to the home team as well. Given the Tigers' strong recent form (6-4 L10) compared to the Twins' struggles (3-7 L10), backing the superior home team is the logical angle, though the price is a bit wide for an official play.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Houston Astros @ Miami Marlins</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This game presents a classic clash of long-term record versus short-term momentum. The Astros (63-50) have the better overall season but are in a deep slump (3-7 L10). The Marlins (55-56) are one of the hottest teams in baseball (7-3 L10). With Houston's pitcher unannounced (TBD) and Miami starting the inconsistent Cal Quantrill (4.82 ERA), the pitching is difficult to model. When pitching is unreliable, the edge often goes to the team with momentum and confidence. The algorithm leans toward the hot-handed Marlins at home, but the unknown starter for Houston makes this a high-variance situation and a stay-away from an official pick.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Baltimore Orioles @ Philadelphia Phillies</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This matchup features a strong home favorite in Philadelphia. The Phillies boast an excellent 36-20 record at home and have the clear pitching advantage with Taijuan Walker (3.86 ERA) on the mound against Baltimore's Dean Kremer (4.24 ERA). Baltimore's struggles on the road (24-35) further cement the Phillies' edge. While both teams are in similar form (6-4 L10), the combination of a superior pitcher and strong home-field advantage makes the Phillies the clear side, though the -133 moneyline is priced efficiently, offering little value for a top-tier play.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Athletics @ Washington Nationals</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This game features two struggling teams, but with conflicting signals. Washington holds the pitching advantage with MacKenzie Gore (3.80 ERA) over Luis Severino (4.85 ERA). However, the Athletics are the much hotter team, going 7-3 in their last 10, while the Nationals are just 3-7. The most powerful trend is the Athletics' incredible 1-8-1 run to the Under in their last 10 games. This suggests their recent success is built on pitching and defense, not offense. With Gore on the other side, the Under 8.5 becomes the most attractive angle, but the model advises a pass due to the overall low quality of the teams.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Cleveland Guardians @ NY Mets</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">The data points heavily towards the Mets in this interleague matchup. The Mets have been one of baseball's most dominant home teams, with a stellar 38-19 record at Citi Field. They also have a notable pitching advantage with Clay Holmes (3.46 ERA) taking the ball against Logan Allen (4.12 ERA). While Cleveland has played .500 baseball on the road, the Mets' overwhelming home-field performance and superior starter make them a strong favorite. The algorithm flags this as a solid lean for New York, but the -183 price is too steep for a primary play.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Tampa Bay Rays @ LA Angels</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">A low-confidence matchup between two teams hovering around .500. The starting pitching is nearly a wash, with the Angels' Jose Soriano (3.65 ERA) and the Rays' Ryan Pepiot (3.81 ERA) posting very similar numbers. The key differentiator is recent form; the Rays are ice-cold, having lost 8 of their last 10 games, while the Angels have been playing better baseball (6-4 L10). The model finds no strong statistical edge in this game, as the mediocre pitching and conflicting team forms create too much uncertainty. This is a clear pass.</p>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">San Diego Padres @ Arizona Diamondbacks</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">The model identifies a massive pitching mismatch that the market may be undervaluing. Arizona's Ryne Nelson has been excellent, posting a 2.74 ERA, and is backed by a team that has gone 8-2 to the Under in its last 10 games, suggesting strong pitching and defense. He faces Padres starter Yu Darvish, who is having a shockingly poor season with a 6.65 ERA. Despite the Padres being the hotter team (7-3 L10), a pitching disparity this large, especially with the better pitcher at home, is too significant to ignore. The value lies with the Diamondbacks, making them a very live underdog.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Milwaukee Brewers @ Atlanta Braves</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This matchup is the model's cornerstone play, identifying a significant market inefficiency. The pricing reflects Atlanta's season-long reputation rather than their current state of collapse (3-7 L10, 26-26 at home). The core of this handicap is the massive starting pitching advantage for Milwaukee. Quinn Priester's 2.70 ERA is supported by a strong FIP, indicating sustainable success. He faces Erick Fedde, whose 5.35 ERA and poor underlying metrics (high walk rate, low K-rate) make him a prime target. The Brewers are hot (7-3 L10) and excel on the road (31-24). All quantifiable data points to Milwaukee.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Cleveland Guardians @ NY Mets</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">The model flags this total as being inflated. The primary driver is Mets ace Sean Manaea, who is in Cy Young form with a spectacular 1.93 ERA. Pitchers performing at this level consistently suppress offenses and drive low-scoring outcomes. While Slade Cecconi (3.79 ERA) for Cleveland isn't an ace, he is a competent arm capable of preventing a blowout. A total of 9 offers a significant cushion for what projects to be a pitcher's duel, dominated by Manaea's elite performance at home (Mets are 38-18 at Citi Field).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Houston Astros @ Miami Marlins</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This is a fundamental play on current form vs. reputation. The Astros are in a catastrophic freefall, going 2-8 in their last 10 games. Conversely, the Marlins are one of the hottest teams in baseball, posting an 8-2 record over the same span. The starting pitching matchup is a virtual wash, with both J. Alexander (5.06 ERA) and Sandy Alcantara (6.36 ERA) struggling immensely. When starting pitching is neutralized, the edge shifts to the team with superior momentum, confidence, and bullpen performance, all of which currently favor Miami. The near-pick'em price is a result of the Astros' brand name, creating clear value on the hot home team.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Minnesota Twins @ Detroit Tigers</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">A clear mismatch in venue performance and starting pitching. The Tigers are a dominant home team with a 36-21 record at Comerica Park. The Twins are one of the league's worst road teams at 22-35. Detroit also holds a significant advantage on the mound, with the reliable Casey Mize (3.45 ERA) facing the inconsistent Simeon Woods Richardson (4.14 ERA). The model finds strong value in backing the superior home team with the better starter.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Toronto Blue Jays @ Colorado Rockies</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">A classic Coors Field total play. The park itself provides a massive offensive boost, a factor compounded by a vulnerable pitching matchup. Rockies starter Tyson Gordon (4.85 ERA) has struggled all season, a dangerous prospect against Toronto's potent lineup. Blue Jays starter Eric Lauer (3.27 ERA), while solid, is a flyball pitcher, the exact profile that gets punished in the thin Denver air. With a hitter-friendly umpire and two capable offenses, the high total of 11.5 is justified and still presents value on the over.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Kansas City Royals @ Boston Red Sox</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">The Red Sox have multiple factors in their favor. They are a strong home team (37-21) and are currently one of the hottest teams in baseball (8-2 L10). They also have the clear pitching advantage with Brayan Bello (3.17 ERA) on the mound against Bailey Falter (3.74 ERA). The model identified this as a strong lean that just missed the official card due to the -153 price, but all indicators point to a Boston victory.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">St. Louis Cardinals @ LA Dodgers</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This matchup features the largest pitching mismatch of the night, with Dodgers ace Tyler Glasnow (3.38 ERA, elite underlying metrics) facing the hittable Sonny Gray (4.39 ERA). The Dodgers are also a strong home team (35-21). However, the price (-181) is prohibitive and offers poor value. The model's strongest lean here is on the F5 Under, given the Dodgers' historic 0-9-1 under trend in their last 10 games and Glasnow's utter dominance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Baltimore Orioles @ Philadelphia Phillies</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">The Phillies are a strong home favorite (-210) with the better starter in Jesus Luzardo (4.31 ERA) against the struggling Cade Povich (5.46 ERA). While a Phillies win is the most likely outcome, the price is far too steep to be a profitable long-term wager. The model identifies the line as efficient and therefore unplayable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">New York Yankees @ Texas Rangers</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This game presents conflicting signals. The Yankees have a clear pitching advantage with ace Max Fried (2.62 ERA) on the mound. However, the Yankees have been a poor road team (26-30), while the Rangers excel at home (34-20). With the pitching advantage clashing with the home/road performance data, the model finds no clear edge and advises a pass.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Cincinnati Reds @ Chi. Cubs</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Another matchup with conflicting data. The Cubs are an excellent home team (35-20), but the Reds have the superior starting pitcher in Nick Lodolo (3.09 ERA) over Mike Soroka (4.89 ERA). The model is unable to find a confident edge when the better pitcher is on the road against a team with such a strong home-field advantage. This is a high-variance game and a clear pass.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">San Francisco Giants @ Pittsburgh Pirates</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">High unpredictability makes this a stay-away. Justin Verlander's 4.55 ERA signals a significant decline, and the Pirates are a tough opponent at home (31-25). However, the massive unknown surrounding Pirates starter Johan Oviedo (0.00 ERA suggests a debut or an extremely small sample size) makes this impossible to model accurately. The algorithm avoids games with critical unknown variables.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Tampa Bay Rays @ LA Angels</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">A low-quality matchup between two sub-.500 teams. Rays starter Adrian Houser's 2.12 ERA is misleading, with an xFIP nearly two runs higher, making him a prime regression candidate. The Angels' Yusei Kikuchi is notoriously inconsistent. The model finds no reliable edge in betting on mediocre teams with unpredictable pitching.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">San Diego Padres @ Arizona Diamondbacks</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This game features two struggling teams (Arizona is 3-7 L10) and two vulnerable starting pitchers in JP Sears (4.95 ERA) and Brandon Pfaadt (5.12 ERA). The model finds no discernible edge in this matchup due to the poor quality of play and high degree of unpredictability. This is a clear "no-bet" directive.</p>
            </div>

            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Houston Astros @ Boston Red Sox</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This AL showdown features a significant and historically proven pitching mismatch that the moneyline doesn't fully capture. Astros ace Framber Valdez (2.62 ERA) is an elite groundball pitcher whose profile is perfectly suited to neutralize the dimensions of Fenway Park. More importantly, his career numbers against Boston are stellar, boasting a sub-2.00 ERA. He faces Lucas Giolito, who has been consistently shelled by Houston throughout his career, with an ERA approaching 6.00 against them. Giolito's fly-ball tendencies against the Astros' disciplined approach is a recipe for disaster.</p>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">The Astros have been a reliable road team (27-25), while the Red Sox are due for a cool-down after a four-game win streak. Valdez's ability to generate weak contact and keep the ball on the infield gives Houston a massive advantage. Our model identifies a clear value edge on the Astros moneyline, primarily driven by the drastic difference in pitcher effectiveness in this specific matchup.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Milwaukee Brewers @ Washington Nationals</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This is a classic case of a top-tier contender against a team in a deep rebuild, amplified by a massive pitching disparity. The Brewers send out top prospect J. Misiorowski (2.73 ERA), whose advanced metrics (sub-3.20 xFIP, elite K-rate) point to a future ace. He faces Brad Lord, a replacement-level arm whose 3.86 ERA is masking a much higher xFIP of over 4.80. This gives Milwaukee a huge advantage from the first pitch, making the First 5 Innings line particularly attractive.</p>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">The situational trends are just as lopsided. The Brewers are a strong road team (30-24) and have dominated the Nationals, winning the last five head-to-head contests. Milwaukee's offense also ranks in the top 5 in wRC+ against right-handed pitching. With advantages in starting pitching, offense, bullpen, and recent history, both the full-game and F5 moneyline present strong, correlated value.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="picks-table-container" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Pittsburgh Pirates @ Colorado Rockies</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This matchup is a textbook recipe for an offensive explosion. The game takes place in Coors Field, the most hitter-friendly environment in all of sports. This factor is magnified by the Rockies' starting pitcher, B. Blalock, who has been a disaster this season with a 7.20 ERA and an xFIP to match, indicating he gets hit extremely hard. His profile is the worst possible fit for the high altitude of Denver.</p>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">While the Pirates have their ace, Mitch Keller, on the mound, even elite pitchers often struggle to adjust to the thin air, which reduces pitch movement. Both teams have also been swinging hot bats, each going 7-3 in their last 10 games, and both bullpens rank in the bottom half of the league. Every single variable—pitching, park factor, and recent offensive form—points towards a high-scoring game that should comfortably surpass the 11.5 total.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">This total is a direct attack on two vulnerable starting pitchers. The White Sox's Sean Burke (4.45 ERA) and the Angels' Jack Kochanowicz (5.79 ERA) both have underlying metrics (FIP over 5.00) that confirm their struggles are legitimate. Neither pitcher possesses the ability to miss bats at a high rate, which leads to constant traffic on the bases and high-stress innings.</p>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">Both teams' bullpens also rank in the bottom third of the league, meaning there will be little relief once the ineffective starters exit the game. Both lineups have enough power to capitalize on the frequent mistakes they are likely to see from the opposing pitching staffs. Recent trends show both teams have been playing in higher-scoring games, and with this pitching matchup, that trend is very likely to continue. The total of 9 is too low for the poor quality of arms involved.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">Our model flags this total of 8 runs as a market inefficiency. A total this low is usually reserved for games with at least one quality starting pitcher, which this matchup lacks. The Orioles are starting Ben Young, who has been hit hard all season, posting a 6.75 ERA. The Cubs counter with Cade Rea, whose 4.74 ERA and high FIP indicate he is also quite hittable. Neither arm is expected to control the game.</p>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">Both lineups are more than capable, ranking in the top half of the league in key offensive categories like ISO and wOBA. The Cubs, in particular, are very tough at home, with a 34-20 record at Wrigley Field. Given the two subpar starting pitchers and two potent offenses, the probability of this game turning into a mid-to-high scoring affair is much greater than the 8-run total implies.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">Dodgers ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto (2.64 ERA) gives them a massive edge over Tampa's Joe Boyle (4.50 ERA). The Dodgers have been trending heavily Under (1-8-1 in last 10), relying on their elite pitching. The price is steep, but the Dodgers are the clear side. The Under 8.5 is also in play given L.A.'s recent trend and Yamamoto's dominance.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">A clash of trends. The Reds have been an Under machine (0-7-2 last 9), while the Braves have trended Over. The key is Reds starter Chase Burns (6.33 ERA), who is highly vulnerable. Despite Atlanta's abysmal road record (20-37), their offense could finally wake up against a struggling rookie pitcher.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">The Blue Jays are nearly unbeatable at home (38-18). However, they face Royals' ace Seth Lugo (3.05 ERA), which neutralizes much of their advantage. The Royals have been a fantastic bet against the spread on the road (36-19). This makes the Royals a very live underdog, and the value lies with them at +129.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">A matchup between two struggling offenses and two hittable pitchers in Jose Urena (4.50 ERA) and Joey Cantillo (4.71 ERA). Both teams are 3-7 in their last 10 games and have trended Under. In a low-confidence game, the Under 8.5 is the only logical look, betting on the continued ineptitude of both lineups.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">The Mets are dominant at home (38-17) and playing good baseball (6-4 last 10). They face a struggling Giants team (3-7 last 10) starting Carson Whisenhunt and his 7.20 ERA. This is a mismatch in every category, and the Mets ML, despite the juice, is the clear side. The run line also offers solid value.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">A fascinating pitching matchup between Luis Gil and Edward Cabrera. The Yankees are hot (8-2 last 10), but the Marlins have been profitable against the spread this season (66-43). The most compelling trend is the clash between the Yankees Over (6-3-1) and the Marlins Under (2-7-1). With two good arms on the mound, the Under 8 is the lean.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">Two teams trending in opposite directions. The A's are hot (7-3 last 10) while the D-backs are ice-cold (2-8 last 10). Both teams have been trending heavily to the Under. Oakland's J. Perkins has been excellent in limited starts, while Arizona's Eduardo Rodriguez (5.67 ERA) has struggled. The value lies with the hot home team.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">The Padres are an elite home team (35-19) with a significant pitching advantage, as the reliable Dylan Cease faces the hittable Andre Pallante. The Padres are in better form (6-4 last 10) than the Cardinals (4-6). All signs point to a comfortable home victory for San Diego.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">A clash of titans on the mound with Jacob deGrom facing the Mariners. However, Seattle has been a cash cow for Under bettors (2-8 O/U last 10), and T-Mobile park is a pitcher's haven. Even against deGrom, the Mariners have a knack for keeping games close and low-scoring at home. The Under 7.5 is the strongest play here.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="picks-table-container" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">

                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">A huge pitching mismatch favors the Phillies. Cristopher Sanchez (2.56 ERA) has been brilliant, while the Tigers' Charlie Morton (5.72 ERA) has been struggling mightily. The Phillies are a strong home team (34-20) and have trended Over recently (6-2-2). This is a prime spot for the Phillies to score runs and secure a comfortable win.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    This AL East matchup presents a stark contrast on the mound. Yankees starter Marcus Stroman is in the midst of a disastrous season, with his 6.09 ERA being validated by an equally poor 5.20 FIP and an alarming 44.2% hard-hit rate allowed. His struggles are magnified in day games, where his ERA climbs over 7.00. The Rays will counter with Ryan Pepiot, whose solid 3.43 ERA is backed by a strong 3.65 FIP and excellent contact management metrics, including a barrel rate against of just 6.1%.
                </p>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    Situational factors further complicate things for New York. The game is a day contest after a night game, with wind blowing out at Yankee Stadium, creating favorable conditions for hitters. The Yankees' bullpen has seen significant usage recently, whereas the Rays' key arms are more rested. While the Yankees (59-49) have a superior overall record and a strong 33-22 home mark, the Rays (54-55) have performed well against the spread on the road, suggesting they often play better than their record indicates in these spots.

                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    This game is a prime candidate for offensive fireworks, driven by a combination of a regression-prone pitcher and an explosive offense meeting in a hitter's paradise. Reds starter Andrew Abbott boasts a fantastic 2.13 ERA, but his underlying metrics (3.85 FIP, 4.10 xFIP) suggest he has been the beneficiary of significant good luck. His opponent, the Atlanta Braves, presents the most difficult test imaginable, as they lead MLB with a 125 wRC+ against left-handed pitching and possess a lineup filled with power.
                </p>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    The environmental conditions create a perfect storm for runs. Great American Ball Park is one of the most home-run-friendly stadiums in baseball. The weather forecast calls for a warm, humid evening, and the home plate umpire, Adam Beck, has one of the most hitter-friendly strike zones in the league. The Braves (45-62) have struggled recently (2-8 in their last 10), but their advanced contact metrics remain strong, indicating a breakout is imminent. The Reds (57-52) have been solid at home (32-24), but the pitching and environmental factors are too significant to ignore.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="picks-table-container">
                <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-primary); color: var(--glow-color); margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--glass-border); padding-bottom: 15px;">Texas Rangers @ Seattle Mariners</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    This divisional clash projects as a classic pitcher's duel. Mariners ace George Kirby's 4.50 ERA is highly misleading; his 3.60 FIP and MLB-best walk rate indicate he is an elite pitcher who has been the victim of some bad luck and is due for significant positive regression. He pitches in his home park, T-Mobile Park, which is one of the most pitcher-friendly environments in the league, and the roof is expected to be closed, further suppressing offense. The Rangers will start rookie Kumar Rocker, who has struggled with a 5.80 ERA and a high walk rate of 11.5%.
                </p>
                <p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    The recent form of the offenses presents a fascinating conflict. The Rangers (57-52) have been hot, going 7-3 in their last 10 games with their offense clicking. However, the Mariners (57-52) have been ice-cold at the plate, going 4-6 with a strong 2-8 trend towards the under. With two elite bullpens backing up the starters and the game being played in a pitcher's sanctuary, the conditions heavily favor a low-scoring game where Kirby's elite command neutralizes the hot Rangers bats.
