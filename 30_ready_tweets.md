## VALUE/EDUCATION TWEETS (5)

### Tweet 16
```
💡 BETTING TIP:

Never chase losses

Bet the same unit size whether you're up or down

Consistency = long term profit

Kelly Criterion calculator: betlegendpicks.com/kelly-criterion

#BettingStrategy
```

### Tweet 17
```
Most bettors lose because:

❌ Bet with emotion
❌ Chase parlays
❌ No bankroll management
❌ Ignore the data

Winners do the opposite

Which one are you? 🤔

Quick math 🧮

If you win 55% at -110 odds:
+$450 profit per $1000 bet

If you win 50%:
-$50 loss per $1000 bet

That 5% matters MORE than you think
