    <div class="post-header">• Pirates First 5 Innings -135 – July 21, 2025</div>
    <div class="post-time">Posted: 12:00 AM – July 21, 2025</div>
    <p>Paul Skenes is becoming a must-back early innings option. He takes the mound for Pittsburgh against Detroit with a 2.61 ERA and a 0.96 WHIP, and he's been dominant the first time through the order. Opponents are hitting just .186 against him over the first five innings, and he's averaging more than 6 strikeouts before the bullpen even gets moving. Jack Flaherty is on the bump for Detroit, and while he's been decent overall, his early-game numbers lag. Opponents are hitting over .280 off him the first time through the lineup, and his command has been shaky out of the gate.</p>
    <p>The Pirates offense is also heating up early. They’ve scored in the first inning in three straight games and continue to see strong at-bats from Bryan Reynolds and Oneil Cruz. This is a solid buy-low spot on Pittsburgh in the first five innings, especially avoiding their volatile bullpen. If Skenes is dialed in again, this line could close closer to -160 by first pitch.</p>
    <p><strong>PICK: Pirates First 5 Innings -135</strong></p>
