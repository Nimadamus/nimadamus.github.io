  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    Thursday’s MLB betting slate features a sharp edge in the Bay Area, where the San Francisco Giants host the Cleveland Guardians at Oracle Park. With Logan Webb on the mound for the Giants and Gavin Williams going for Cleveland, we’re backing the home side at <strong>-168</strong> in what our model considers a clear value spot.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    <strong>Let’s get this out of the way:</strong> Logan Webb has been dominant in 2025. He enters this start with a 2.58 ERA, 1.12 WHIP, and 105 strikeouts across 94.1 innings. His xERA (2.73) and SIERA (3.14) both confirm the performance is sustainable, not luck-based. He’s allowing just a .278 wOBA and is holding opponents to a hard-hit rate under 33%, which ranks in the top 15% of qualified starters. Even better, he’s given up <strong>zero stolen bases all year</strong> — a sign of both elite mechanics and catcher chemistry.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    At Oracle Park, Webb has been even more effective: a 1.38 ERA at home over his last seven starts, including matchups against offenses like Atlanta, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Over that span, his ground ball rate is a staggering 59.1% — second only to Framber Valdez among qualified starters. He has the unique ability to miss barrels while inducing weak contact, especially on 2-strike counts where hitters are slashing just .191/.233/.255.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    Offensively, San Francisco has found its rhythm. The Giants rank 8th in MLB in OPS over the past 30 days (.768), and they’ve been especially lethal at home with a .282 team batting average at Oracle since June 1. Thairo Estrada and Matt Chapman are both hitting over .300 this month, and Michael Conforto has quietly raised his OBP to .355 in June — providing protection and plate discipline in the heart of the order.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    Meanwhile, Cleveland continues to sputter at the plate. They enter this game ranked 22nd in wRC+ (92) and 24th in hard-hit rate. In June alone, they’re averaging just 3.7 runs per game and have posted a .289 OBP, one of the worst marks in the league. Even when they get traffic, they’ve been one of the least efficient teams converting RISP situations (batting .216 with men on 2nd or 3rd).
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    As for Gavin Williams, the Cleveland righty has posted a 4.21 ERA on the season with a FIP of 4.45 and a troubling 10.2% walk rate. He’s been unable to generate swings and misses with consistency — just a 9.4% swinging strike rate — and has shown noticeable third-time-through-the-order drops, where opponents are slashing .293/.371/.510. That’s a red flag against a Giants lineup that grinds out at-bats and ranks 6th in MLB in pitches seen per plate appearance (4.01).
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    Our model has this game priced closer to <strong>Giants -181</strong>, implying a 64.4% win probability. That gives us a slight but meaningful edge at the current -168 price. It’s worth noting that sharp action is aligning with this: 55% of tickets are on San Francisco, but 71% of the money is — a strong indication that respected bettors are backing Webb and the home side.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    Additional trend support: the Giants are 21–10 at home this season, and Logan Webb has covered the moneyline in 8 of his last 11 home starts when favored by -140 or more. San Francisco also boasts the 4th-best bullpen ERA (3.11) and ranks top-5 in leverage hold rate — meaning they’re more likely to close out leads when they have them. In contrast, Cleveland’s bullpen has blown 9 saves in their last 26 chances.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    No traps here. No system fade. No trendy dog angle. This is simply a strong team at home with an elite pitcher on the mound, facing an inconsistent offense with a volatile starter. The model sees value. The stats back it up. And the betting market is quietly following suit.
  </p>

    <strong>Final Pick: Giants -168</strong>
