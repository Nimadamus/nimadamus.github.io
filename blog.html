  <h2>May 20 Picks â€“ Straight to Business</h2>
  <div class="date">May 20, 2025</div>

  <p>Weâ€™re not here to waste time â€” hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m rolling with for Tuesday, May 20.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™ve dug into the matchups, pitchers, weather, trends, and numbers. These arenâ€™t gut plays â€” theyâ€™re edges I actually believe in.</p>

  <h3>ðŸ”¹ Reds ML (-124)</h3>
  <p><strong>(Martinez vs Falter)</strong><br>
  The Pirates are ice cold at the plate and Bailey Falter isnâ€™t the guy to turn that around. Martinez has been efficient, and the Reds' bats are heating up â€” especially against lefties. At -124, Iâ€™ll take the better lineup and pen.</p>

  <h3>ðŸ”¹ Phillies / Rockies Over 10.5 (-115)</h3>
  <p><strong>(Luzardo vs Senzatela)</strong><br>
  Coors Field. Senzatela. Wind out. Neither starter has swing-and-miss stuff. Total's high for a reason â€” and honestly could be higher. Iâ€™m in at 10.5 (-115).</p>

  <h3>ðŸ”¹ Twins ML (Game 2) -112</h3>
  <p><strong>(Paddack vs Williams)</strong><br>
  This is for <strong>Game 2</strong> of the doubleheader. Paddackâ€™s control should keep him efficient deep into the game, and Minnesotaâ€™s offense gets a much better matchup the second time around. Solid edge at this price.</p>

  <h3>ðŸ”¹ Cubs / Marlins Under 8.5 (-110)</h3>
  <p><strong>(Taillon vs Weathers)</strong><br>
  Weathers has looked better than expected, and Taillonâ€™s ground-ball rate is up. These teams donâ€™t scare me offensively, and conditions favor a lower total. Holding my nose and playing the Under.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™ll track these by the numbers â€” risk 1 unit each. Letâ€™s get it.</p>

  <h2>No Gimmicks. No Deleting Picks. Just Real Transparency.</h2>
  <div class="date">May 19, 2025</div>

  <p>Letâ€™s get something straight.</p>

  <p>Weâ€™re not here to sell you dreams. Weâ€™re not throwing out fake 10-unit bombs, inflating records, or pretending like every pick is a lock. This isnâ€™t that kind of site.</p>

  <p>At <strong>BetLegend</strong>, everything you see is real:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We post every pick â€” win or lose</li>
    <li>We never delete plays</li>
    <li>We track results publicly</li>
    <li>We use standard unit sizing and real-world odds</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are no doctored screenshots, no mystery systems, no paid VIP plays. We donâ€™t cherry-pick wins or hide losses.</p>

  <p>Weâ€™re here to bet like pros â€” with discipline, honesty, and full transparency.</p>

  <p>That means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If we go 1-3, itâ€™s on the board.</li>
    <li>If we sweep, itâ€™s on the board.</li>
    <li>Every play. Every day. No hiding.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>If youâ€™re tired of the noise in this industry, welcome. Youâ€™re in the right place.</strong></p>

  <h2>Stick Around. You Might Be the Next Legend.</h2>
  <div class="date">May 20, 2025</div>

  <p>Iâ€™m locked in â€” not going anywhere.</p>

  <p>This site isnâ€™t just about picks. Itâ€™s about building something real. Something sharp. Something loud.</p>

  <p>We donâ€™t follow trends. We set the line.</p>

  <p>So if youâ€™re here early, stick around â€” because the next legend might be you.</p>
