  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Rare 2 Unit Bomb on Rangers – Full July 23rd MLB Card</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px; color: gray;">Posted: July 23, 2025 – 1:48 AM</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="texoa.png" style="width: 85%;" />
  </div>
  <p>This is the first time in a while we’ve gone with a two-unit play, and for good reason. We’re sitting at 1 and 0 on the year with these rare spots, and we’re looking to move to 2 and 0 behind a strong edge in Texas. The Rangers are back home, where they’ve been solid all season, and they send Patrick Corbin to the mound. Corbin enters this matchup with a 3.91 ERA and has looked sharp in July. In his most recent outing, he tossed five and two-thirds scoreless innings and struck out six. He’s doing a better job keeping the ball on the ground and limiting hard contact early in counts.</p>

  <p>Oakland counters with JP Sears, who has a 5.17 ERA and has given up a .274 opponent batting average on the year. Sears has had particular trouble with left-handed hitters and hasn’t shown much consistency on the road. The A’s are just 22 and 30 away from home this season and continue to rank near the bottom of the league in runs scored per game. Texas, on the other hand, is 30 and 20 at home and has won seven of its last ten. They’ve been getting production from all over the lineup lately and are simply in a better rhythm on both sides of the ball. The Rangers have the bullpen edge too, which gives them a clear advantage if this turns into a close game late.</p>

  <p>We’re not the type to throw around two-unit plays every day. This is a spot where everything lines up. The home form, the pitching matchup, the splits, and the momentum are all pointing the same way. It’s a full confidence swing, and we’re riding with Texas to deliver.</p>

  <p>Now here’s the rest of the card for July 23rd:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Brewers and Mariners First 5 Innings Under 4.5 at -140</li>
    <li>Guardians First 5 Innings -140</li>
    <li>Padres -148</li>
    <li>Mets and Angels First 5 Innings Over 4.5 at -135</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In Seattle, Quinn Priester takes the ball for Milwaukee with a 2.65 ERA. He’s been efficient and keeps the ball in the yard. The Mariners counter with Luis Castillo, who holds a 3.21 ERA and has been strong at home. Both starters have been consistent this month, and the under trend in first five innings has been favorable when these types of arms match up. Milwaukee has gone five and five to the over in their last ten, while Seattle has hit the over in seven of their last ten, but many of those runs have come late in games. This sets up for a lower scoring start before the bullpens get involved.</p>

  <p>Cleveland continues to be one of the hottest teams in baseball, winning eight of their last ten. They’re back home against Baltimore and face Zach Eflin, who comes in with a 5.95 ERA. Eflin has been getting hit hard and has not been able to locate consistently in recent outings. The Guardians have been very good in the early innings this season, and they’re now 27 and 21 at home overall. Cleveland’s lineup is putting together quality at-bats and finding ways to score early, while the bullpen continues to hold leads when it has to. This feels like another strong spot for them in the first five innings.</p>

  <p>The Padres are on the road against Arizona, and they’ve looked much more consistent lately. They’ve outscored opponents by 23 runs since the All-Star break and have tightened up the back end of their bullpen. San Diego’s offense is starting to come through in key spots, and they’ve won six of their last ten. Arizona has hovered around .500 but hasn’t put together a strong stretch. They’ve struggled in close games and haven’t been able to rely on their pitching to hold up. San Diego has the edge in multiple areas and should be in a good spot here if they play clean baseball.</p>

  <p>And finally, we’ve got what could be a high-scoring game in Anaheim between the Mets and Angels. Both teams come into this matchup trending toward the over. The Mets have gone seven and three to the over in their last ten, and the Angels bullpen has an ERA north of five over the last month. This game features two starters who have been inconsistent and allow a lot of traffic on the bases. Both offenses are capable of putting up crooked numbers, especially early. The weather is warm and conditions favor the hitters, so the first five innings over makes a lot of sense given how these teams have been swinging the bats.</p>

  <p>We’re going into this slate with five solid angles, led by the Rangers as our rare two-unit bomb. It’s all backed by real data, live trends, and matchup context. Let’s see if Texas can take care of business and set the tone for the day.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    Looking ahead to Tuesday’s slate, a handful of early edges stood out based on starting pitcher splits and situational trends. We’ve got five picks that all share a common theme—favorable matchups in the first five innings or with team totals that look inflated.
  </p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    Boston faces Cristopher Sanchez in Philly, and that’s a tough task right now. Sanchez has been carving through lineups early, and Boston’s offense hasn’t traveled well this season. The number is low, but under 3.5 still feels playable.
  </p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    The Astros draw a beatable arm in Arizona and have Framber Valdez going for them. We’re backing them in the first five. Valdez doesn’t mess around—he works fast and puts up zeroes early, especially against weaker lineups.
  </p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    St. Louis heads into Coors Field with Erick Fedde, who’s quietly been reliable early. Colorado’s starter, meanwhile, is rocking an ERA over 11. This play is more about the Rockies being a disaster than the Cards being elite.
  </p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    We’re also taking the Braves under 4.5 runs against Atlanta’s rookie opponent. The line feels about a run too high given how Atlanta’s bats have looked lately, and the starting matchup doesn’t help their case.
  </p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
    Lastly, we’re going with the Phillies on the first five run line. Richard Fitts is on the hill for Boston and it’s a bad setup for him. Philly should be able to get to him early while Sanchez gives them breathing room on the other side.
  </p>
<ul style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 24px;">
<li>Red Sox Team Total Under 3.5 (–125)</li>
<li>Astros First 5 Innings ML (–145)</li>
<li>Cardinals First 5 Innings ML (–160)</li>
<li>Braves Team Total Under 4.5 (–115)</li>
<li>Phillies First 5 –0.5 (–140)</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 24px;">
    Five edges, all backed by real numbers. Let’s see how it plays out.

<div class="post-header">• Pirates First 5 Innings -135 – July 21, 2025</div>
<div class="post-time">Posted: 12:00 AM – July 21, 2025</div>
<p>Paul Skenes is becoming a must-back early innings option. He takes the mound for Pittsburgh against Detroit with a 2.61 ERA and a 0.96 WHIP, and he's been dominant the first time through the order. Opponents are hitting just .186 against him over the first five innings, and he's averaging more than 6 strikeouts before the bullpen even gets moving. Jack Flaherty is on the bump for Detroit, and while he's been decent overall, his early-game numbers lag. Opponents are hitting over .280 off him the first time through the lineup, and his command has been shaky out of the gate.</p>
<p>The Pirates offense is also heating up early. They’ve scored in the first inning in three straight games and continue to see strong at-bats from Bryan Reynolds and Oneil Cruz. This is a solid buy-low spot on Pittsburgh in the first five innings, especially avoiding their volatile bullpen. If Skenes is dialed in again, this line could close closer to -160 by first pitch.</p>
<p><strong>PICK: Pirates First 5 Innings -135</strong></p>
