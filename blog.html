      <p><strong>Pick 1 – MLB:</strong> Astros vs. Rays <strong>Under 9 (-120)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Pick 2 – NHL:</strong> Stars Team Total <strong>Under 3.5 (-150)</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Why we like these:</strong></p>

      <p>
        Let’s start in Tampa. Hunter Brown is dealing — flat out. His surface-level ERA of 1.43 is already elite, but it’s the underlying numbers that
        really tell the story: 2.71 xERA, 89th percentile in barrel rate, and he's limiting hard contact better than almost any pitcher in baseball.
        Pair that with a Houston bullpen that leads the majors with a 2.64 ERA, and you've got a setup where Tampa’s already shaky lineup is going to
        have trouble putting up more than 3 or 4 runs.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the flip side, Taj Bradley isn’t perfect — his ERA is inflated — but he’s shown flashes, especially when locating his fastball. Houston’s
        offense has also been wildly inconsistent. They’re bottom-third in the league in runs per game on the road (just 3.57) and have been especially
        flat early in day games. This sets up beautifully for a tight, slow-paced matchup.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our model simulates this game finishing around 4.2 to 3.1, putting the total at roughly 7.3 runs. The posted line of 9 gives us value. At -120,
        the implied probability is 54.5%. Our model gives the Under a 61.8% chance of hitting. That’s a clear edge of +7.3%, and that’s exactly the kind
        of bet we look for — mathematically sound, fundamentally supported.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let’s talk hockey — and let’s get precise. This is one of those plays that casual bettors might miss. Everyone sees the total at 6 and thinks
        full game under, but the sharper move is to isolate Dallas’ scoring specifically. The Stars have scored more than 3 goals in just 2 of their last 9
        playoff games. They rely heavily on tight puck control and structured defense, not volume offense. Against most teams, that’s fine. But not tonight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Edmonton is coming off back-to-back shutouts. Stuart Skinner is locked in with a .935 SV% this month and has gotten much better at controlling
        rebounds and sealing off the post. Our xG model gives Dallas just 2.97 expected goals in this matchup — and that’s a generous projection.
      </p>

      <p>
        At -150, the Stars team total under 3.5 needs to cash 60% of the time to break even. We make it 67.4% based on sim data, form, and opponent context.
        That gives us an edge of +7.4% — not massive, but definitely enough to fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are the types of plays that don’t just come from vibe-checking the board. These come from digging deep — from models, matchup data,
        and recognizing inefficiencies in lines the public might not be seeing. Let’s keep pushing edges and stacking value.
