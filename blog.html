     <p><strong>Pick 1 – MLB:</strong> Astros vs. Rays <strong>Under 9 (-120)</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Pick 2 – NHL:</strong> Stars Team Total <strong>Under 3.5 (-150)</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Pick 3 – MLB:</strong> Giants ML <strong>(-200)</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Pick 4 – MLB:</strong> Royals Team Total Under 3.5 <strong>(-115)</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Why we like these:</strong></p>

      <p>
        Let’s start in Tampa. Hunter Brown is dealing — flat out. His surface-level ERA of 1.43 is already elite, but it’s the underlying numbers that
        really tell the story: 2.71 xERA, 89th percentile in barrel rate, and he's limiting hard contact better than almost any pitcher in baseball.
        Pair that with a Houston bullpen that leads the majors with a 2.64 ERA, and you've got a setup where Tampa’s already shaky lineup is going to
        have trouble putting up more than 3 or 4 runs.
      </p>
        <p>Let’s talk Giants. I know this team better than anyone — and this is a prime spot. Logan Webb at home is as good as it gets. He’s rocking a 0.64 ERA at Oracle Park this year, and when he’s on the mound, the team feeds off it. His command, his sinker, the rhythm he brings — it just works. He’s not just an ace, he’s our identity.</p>
       <p>Daniel Lynch starts for KC and honestly, I don’t get the hype. He hasn’t started a single game this year and the last time he faced the Giants he got smacked around, recorded one out, and left the game. The guy’s been pitching in relief — and now he's supposed to stretch out as a starter in San Francisco? Against a team that’s 17–8 at home? Nah.</p>
       <p>The Royals lineup is ice cold. Outside of Bobby Witt Jr., there’s just no real threat. They’re scoring barely 3.3 runs a game on the season, and they’ve been held under 4 runs in 42 of their 50 games. Against Webb, that’s not a team I’m afraid of — that’s a team I’m fading hard.</p>
       <p>These are both high-confidence spots for me. Giants ML is a play I’d make every time Webb pitches at home against a weak opponent, and the Royals TT under is just math. They’re not scoring 4 off Webb and this bullpen. Let’s ride.</p>

      <p>
        On the flip side, Taj Bradley isn’t perfect — his ERA is inflated — but he’s shown flashes, especially when locating his fastball. Houston’s
        offense has also been wildly inconsistent. They’re bottom-third in the league in runs per game on the road (just 3.57) and have been especially
        flat early in day games. This sets up beautifully for a tight, slow-paced matchup.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our model simulates this game finishing around 4.2 to 3.1, putting the total at roughly 7.3 runs. The posted line of 9 gives us value. At -120,
        the implied probability is 54.5%. Our model gives the Under a 61.8% chance of hitting. That’s a clear edge of +7.3%, and that’s exactly the kind
        of bet we look for — mathematically sound, fundamentally supported.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let’s talk hockey — and let’s get precise. This is one of those plays that casual bettors might miss. Everyone sees the total at 6 and thinks
        full game under, but the sharper move is to isolate Dallas’ scoring specifically. The Stars have scored more than 3 goals in just 2 of their last 9
        playoff games. They rely heavily on tight puck control and structured defense, not volume offense. Against most teams, that’s fine. But not tonight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Edmonton is coming off back-to-back shutouts. Stuart Skinner is locked in with a .935 SV% this month and has gotten much better at controlling
        rebounds and sealing off the post. Our xG model gives Dallas just 2.97 expected goals in this matchup — and that’s a generous projection.
      </p>

      <p>
        At -150, the Stars team total under 3.5 needs to cash 60% of the time to break even. We make it 67.4% based on sim data, form, and opponent context.
        That gives us an edge of +7.4% — not massive, but definitely enough to fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are the types of plays that don’t just come from vibe-checking the board. These come from digging deep — from models, matchup data,
        and recognizing inefficiencies in lines the public might not be seeing. Let’s keep pushing edges and stacking value.

         <h2>May 20 Picks – Straight to Business</h2>
  <div class="date">May 20, 2025</div>

  <p>We’re not here to waste time — here’s what I’m rolling with for Tuesday, May 20.</p>

  <p>I’ve dug into the matchups, pitchers, weather, trends, and numbers. These aren’t gut plays — they’re edges I actually believe in.</p>

  <h3>🔹 Reds ML (-124)</h3>
  <p><strong>(Martinez vs Falter)</strong><br>
  San Diego’s starter has been hittable, and I like the Reds’ right-handed bats in this spot. Falter’s been surprisingly solid, and CIN’s bullpen has been better than people realize. Moneyline only here.</p>

  <h3>🔹 Phillies / Rockies Over 10.5</h3>
  <p><strong>(Luzardo vs Senzatela)</strong><br>
  Luzardo’s ERA is hiding some serious issues under the hood — and Senzatela at Coors? No thanks. Ball should be flying here. 10.5 is playable — anything below 11 feels like value.</p>

  <h3>🔹 Twins ML (Game 2) -112</h3>
  <p><strong>(Paddack vs Williams)</strong><br>
  Important: This is <strong>Game 2 of the doubleheader</strong>. Minnesota has the edge with Paddack on the mound, and I expect them to bounce back strong depending on Game 1’s outcome. Watch the lineups, but I’m locked in.</p>

  <h3>🔹 Cubs / Marlins Under 8.5</h3>
  <p><strong>(Taillon vs Weathers)</strong><br>
  Both starters have been steady lately, and I think the market’s slightly off here. Wind is neutral and bullpens are fresh. Not an exciting game, but a slow grind with limited scoring suits the Under.</p>

  <p>I’ll track these by the numbers — risk 1 unit each. Let’s get it.</p>
