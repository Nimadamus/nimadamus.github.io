## POST 5: Bankroll Management Guide

**Title:**
```
Bankroll Management 101 - Why Most Bettors Go Broke (And How to Avoid It)
```

**Body:**
```
What's up r/betlegend,

I see a lot of people asking about bankroll management, so here's everything you need to know:

---

## 💰 WHAT IS BANKROLL MANAGEMENT?

Your bankroll is the money you've set aside ONLY for betting.

**Rule #1:** Only bet money you can afford to lose

---

## 📊 THE UNIT SYSTEM

**1 unit = 1% of your total bankroll**

Example:
- Bankroll: $1,000
- 1 unit = $10

This way, you can handle losing streaks without going broke.

---

## 🎯 BET SIZING

Based on confidence:

- **Low confidence:** 1 unit
- **Medium confidence:** 2 units
- **High confidence:** 3 units
- **MAX:** Never more than 5% of bankroll on one bet

---

## ⚠️ WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ Bet your entire bankroll on one "lock"
❌ Chase losses by doubling bet size
❌ Bet rent money
❌ Go all-in on parlays
❌ Tilt bet after a bad beat

---

## 📈 THE MATH

Even at 55% win rate (good!):

- **Bad bankroll mgmt:** Broke in a month
- **Good bankroll mgmt:** Steady profit over time

Variance WILL happen. Unit betting protects you.

---

## 🧮 KELLY CRITERION

Want to optimize bet sizing? Use the Kelly Criterion:

https://betlegendpicks.com/kelly-criterion

It calculates optimal bet size based on your edge.

---

## 💡 MY SYSTEM

- Start with $1,000 bankroll
- 1 unit = $10
- Typical bet: 1-2 units
- Max bet: 3 units (rare)
- Never risk more than 5% on one play

After a month, recalculate units based on new bankroll.

## POST 7: Hot Take / Discussion

**Title:**
```
Unpopular Opinion: Parlays Are -EV and You Should Stop Betting Them
```

**Body:**
```
Alright r/betlegend, prepare for downvotes but hear me out:

---

## 🎰 THE MATH

Let's say you bet 3-team parlays:

- Each leg is 50/50 (-110 odds)
- True parlay odds should be +700
- Sportsbooks pay +600
- **You're getting -EV on EVERY parlay**

---

## 💸 WHAT YOU LOSE

The more legs you add, the more juice you pay:

- 2-leg parlay: ~10% juice
- 3-leg parlay: ~15% juice
- 5-leg parlay: ~25% juice

You're literally giving sportsbooks free money.

---

## 📊 BETTER STRATEGY

**Instead of:** 3-team parlay ($10 to win $60)

**Do this:** 3 separate $10 bets

- Hit 2/3: +$8 profit (parlay loses $10)
- Hit 3/3: +$27.27 profit (vs $60 on parlay)
- Hit 1/3: -$12 (vs -$10 on parlay)

Long term, singles beat parlays.

---

## 🤔 BUT WHAT ABOUT...

"I hit a 10-leg parlay once!"

Yeah, and casinos love you for it. For every 1 person who hits, 1000 lose.

---

## ⚠️ EXCEPTION

Same-game parlays with correlated outcomes CAN have +EV in specific spots.

Example: Player OVER points + Team ML (correlation = value)

But random parlays? Nah.

Change my mind 👇

Am I wrong? Let's debate.

---

## 📈 MOVING FORWARD

**Season stats still solid:**
- YTD: [X-Y] ([WIN%])
- Units: [+X.Xu total]

Variance happens. Model is sound. Sticking to the process.

---

## 💪 NO TILT BETTING

NOT gonna:
- ❌ Chase losses
- ❌ Increase bet size
- ❌ Make emotional plays

Back to 1-2 unit bets. Trust the process.

---

Transparency matters. We'll bounce back.
