 <h1>Unit Sizing: How to Bet the Right Amount</h1>

 <p>The question every bettor asks: how much should I actually bet? Too much and you risk going broke during a cold streak. Too little and you're leaving money on the table when your edge is real. Unit sizing in betting is the bridge between having a winning strategy and actually turning it into profit. Get it wrong, and even the sharpest handicapper in the world ends up broke or frustrated.</p>

 <p>This guide breaks down everything you need to know about unit sizing for sports betting, from the basics of what a unit actually is to the advanced strategies professionals use to maximize returns while protecting their bankroll. Whether you're betting $20 a game or $2,000, the principles are exactly the same.</p>

 <h2>What Is a Unit in Sports Betting?</h2>
 <p>A unit is your standard bet size expressed as a percentage of your total bankroll. If your bankroll is $5,000 and you're betting 2% per game, one unit is $100. The beauty of units is they scale with your bankroll. When your roll grows to $6,000, your unit grows to $120 automatically.</p>

 <p>This is how you survive <a href="variance.html" style="color:#00ffff;">variance</a>. When you're winning and your bankroll is up, you bet more. When you're losing and your bankroll is down, you bet less. You're never overexposed.</p>

 <p>Think of it this way: the dollar amount of your bet is irrelevant in isolation. What matters is how that dollar amount relates to your total bankroll. A $500 bet from a $50,000 bankroll (1%) is far more conservative than a $500 bet from a $5,000 bankroll (10%). The first bettor can absorb a 10-game losing streak without breaking a sweat. The second bettor is broke. Same dollar amount, completely different risk profiles. That's why professionals think in units, not dollars.</p>

 <p>Units also give you a universal language for tracking performance. When someone says they're up 40 units on the season, you immediately understand the magnitude of their edge regardless of whether their unit is $10 or $1,000. This is how every serious bettor and every credible <a href="../bankroll.html" style="color:#00ffff;">bankroll management system</a> measures results.</p>

 <h2>The Standard Approach: 1-5% Per Bet</h2>
 <p>Most professional bettors use somewhere between 1% and 5% of their bankroll per bet, depending on their confidence and the strength of their edge.</p>

 <p>Here's what that looks like in practice:</p>

 <div class="example-box">
 <p><strong>$5,000 Bankroll</strong></p>
 <p>1% unit = $50 per bet (very conservative)</p>
 <p>2% unit = $100 per bet (standard for most bettors)</p>
 <p>3% unit = $150 per bet (aggressive but manageable)</p>
 <p>5% unit = $250 per bet (only for strong edges)</p>
 </div>

 <p>The 1-2% range is where most successful bettors live. It gives you room to weather normal variance without destroying your bankroll, while still allowing meaningful profit when you're hitting.</p>

 <p>Here's the math that makes this real. At a 2% unit size with a $5,000 bankroll, you could lose 10 straight bets and only be down $1,000, leaving you with $4,000 still in play. That hurts, sure, but you're alive. Losing streaks of 8-12 bets happen more often than most recreational bettors realize, even for sharp bettors hitting at 55%. If you want to understand why that happens, our <a href="variance.html" style="color:#00ffff;">guide to variance in sports betting</a> covers it in detail.</p>

 <p>Now imagine betting 10% per game on that same $5,000 bankroll. Ten straight losses, and you've lost $5,000. You're done. And the cruel part? You might have been making good bets the entire time. Variance doesn't care about your process. Unit sizing is your insurance policy against the randomness built into every sport.</p>

 <h2>Flat Betting vs. Variable Sizing</h2>
 <p>Flat betting means every bet is the same size. You bet 2% on every game regardless of how strong you think the play is. This is simple, disciplined, and it works.</p>

 <p>Variable sizing means you bet more when you have a stronger edge. Maybe 1% on a marginal play and 4% on a game where you've got clear value. This can increase profits if you're good at estimating your edge. But most bettors aren't, so they end up overbetting on plays they're overconfident about. Learn more about the different approaches in our <a href="modern-bankroll-models.html" style="color:#00ffff;">comparison of bankroll models</a>.</p>

 <p>The honest truth? Most bettors who switch to variable sizing end up hurting their bottom line. They pour extra units into games they "love" based on gut feelings and fan bias, not actual edge. If you can't articulate exactly why a bet has more expected value than your standard play, you shouldn't be sizing it up.</p>

 <div class="tip-box">
 <p><strong>The Rule of Thumb:</strong> If you're new to betting or you don't have a proven track record, stick to flat betting at 1-2% per game. Once you've logged 200+ bets and you can prove you're consistently beating the closing line, then consider variable sizing. The discipline of flat betting teaches you patience, and patience is what separates long-term winners from everyone else.</p>
 </div>

 <h2>How Confidence Should Affect Unit Size</h2>
 <p>A lot of bettors confuse confidence with edge. You might be really confident the Lakers cover, but that doesn't mean you have an edge. Confidence is how sure you feel. Edge is how much better your estimate is than the market price.</p>

 <p>If you're going to use variable sizing, base it on edge, not confidence:</p>
 <p>- Clear closing line value and professional analysis on your side: 3-4 units</p>
 <p>- Moderate edge, soft line: 2 units</p>
 <p>- Marginal edge, questionable value: 1 unit or skip</p>

 <p>But again, most bettors overestimate their edge. When in doubt, bet smaller.</p>

 <h2>Unit Sizing for Different Bankroll Sizes</h2>
 <p>Your unit size should reflect not just your bankroll, but also how replaceable that bankroll is.</p>

 <p>If you've got a $50,000 bankroll and losing it would hurt but not ruin you, betting 2-3% per game is fine. That's $1,000 to $1,500 per bet.</p>

 <p>If you've got a $1,000 bankroll and that's all you can afford to risk, betting 1% per game makes more sense. That's $10 per bet. It feels small, but it keeps you in action long enough for skill to overcome variance.</p>

 <h2>Common Unit Sizing Mistakes That Crush Bankrolls</h2>
 <p>The biggest mistake isn't picking the wrong games. It's sizing your bets poorly on the right ones. Here are the most common unit sizing errors that send bettors to the ATM.</p>

 <p><strong>Chasing losses with bigger bets.</strong> You're down 5 units on the day, so you double your next bet to "get it back." This is how bankrolls die. Every bet should be sized based on your current bankroll and your estimated edge, not based on what happened earlier. If you find yourself falling into this trap, our guide on <a href="chasing-losses.html" style="color:#00ffff;">chasing losses</a> is required reading.</p>

 <p><strong>Betting the same dollar amount instead of the same percentage.</strong> If your bankroll drops from $5,000 to $3,500 but you're still betting $100 per game, you've gone from risking 2% to risking nearly 3%. That might not sound like much, but it compounds fast during a cold stretch. Recalculate your unit size regularly.</p>

 <p><strong>Sizing up on parlays and teasers.</strong> A lot of bettors will bet 2 units on straight bets but throw 5 units on a 4-leg parlay because "if it hits, I'm up huge." Parlays already have inflated house edge baked into the math. Oversizing them is lighting money on fire. Your unit size should be the same, or smaller, on correlated and multi-leg bets.</p>

 <p><strong>Having no unit system at all.</strong> Betting $50 on one game, $300 on the next, and $20 on the third based entirely on how you feel? That's not a strategy. That's gambling with extra steps. Even a simple flat betting approach at 1% outperforms random bet sizing over the long run because it removes emotion from the equation.</p>

 <p>Understanding your <a href="risk-of-ruin.html" style="color:#00ffff;">risk of ruin</a> can help you see exactly how these mistakes compound over time, and why proper unit sizing is the single most important variable in your long-term betting survival.</p>

 <h2>When to Increase Your Unit Size</h2>
 <p>Your unit size should increase when your bankroll increases, but it should happen gradually based on actual results, not because you hit a hot streak and feel invincible. We cover this in depth in our guide on <a href="increasing-unit-size.html" style="color:#00ffff;">when to scale up your bets</a>.</p>

 <p>Recalculate weekly. If your bankroll is up 15% over the last month because you've been hitting consistently, your unit size naturally increases by 15%. But you don't suddenly jump from 2% to 5% because you won five in a row.</p>

 <h2>The $100 Unit Myth</h2>
 <p>A lot of betting content online talks about "units" as if everyone's unit is $100. That's nonsense. Your unit is personal. It's based on your bankroll, not some arbitrary number.</p>

 <p>If your bankroll is $500, your unit might be $10. If your bankroll is $50,000, your unit might be $1,000. There's no one-size-fits-all number. What matters is the percentage of your total bankroll you're risking per bet.</p>

 <h2>Unit Sizing and the Kelly Criterion</h2>
 <p>If you want to get mathematical about unit sizing, the <a href="../kelly-criterion.html" style="color:#00ffff;">Kelly Criterion</a> is the gold standard. Kelly is a formula that tells you the optimal percentage of your bankroll to bet based on your estimated edge and the odds being offered. It's the only mathematically proven method for maximizing long-term bankroll growth.</p>

 <p>The Kelly formula works like this: if you estimate you have a 55% chance of winning a bet at -110 odds, Kelly tells you to bet approximately 5.5% of your bankroll. That's aggressive, which is why most professionals use "fractional Kelly," betting one-quarter or one-half of the recommended amount to smooth out the volatility.</p>

 <p>Here's why this connects to unit sizing: Kelly gives you a framework for when variable sizing actually makes sense. Instead of arbitrarily betting 3 units on a game you "feel good about," Kelly lets you size bets proportionally to your actual edge. A bet where you estimate 58% win probability at -110 gets sized larger than a bet where you estimate 52%. It's structured, it's disciplined, and it takes the guesswork out of bet sizing.</p>

 <p>The catch? Kelly requires you to accurately estimate your win probability, and most bettors are terrible at that. Overestimate your edge even slightly, and Kelly will have you overbetting. That's why we recommend starting with flat betting, graduating to a simple tiered system (1-3 units based on confidence), and only moving to Kelly once you have hundreds of tracked bets proving your ability to estimate true win probabilities. For a deeper dive into how different approaches compare, check our <a href="modern-bankroll-models.html" style="color:#00ffff;">modern bankroll models breakdown</a>.</p>

 <h2>Building Your Unit Sizing System</h2>
 <p>So where does all of this leave you? Here's the practical framework. Start by defining your bankroll, the total amount of money set aside exclusively for betting. Not your rent money. Not your savings. A separate, dedicated bankroll you can afford to lose entirely without affecting your life.</p>

 <p>Next, pick your unit size. If you're a recreational bettor or you're still building a track record, go with 1% per bet. If you're experienced with a proven win rate over 500+ bets, 2-3% is reasonable. Nobody should be betting more than 5% on any single wager unless they have extraordinary, verifiable edge.</p>

 <p>Then, commit to recalculating. At least once a week, look at your current bankroll and adjust your unit size accordingly. If your bankroll grew from $5,000 to $5,800, your 2% unit goes from $100 to $116. If it dropped to $4,200, your unit drops to $84. This automatic scaling is what keeps you in the game during losing streaks and compounds your gains during winning stretches. We cover the specifics of when and how to adjust in our <a href="increasing-unit-size.html" style="color:#00ffff;">guide to increasing unit size</a>.</p>

 <p>Finally, track everything. Log every bet with the unit size, the odds, and the result. Over time, your data will tell you whether your unit sizing approach is working. Are your 3-unit plays actually winning at a higher rate than your 1-unit plays? If not, you're better off flat betting. Let the numbers make the decision for you.</p>

 <p>Unit sizing isn't glamorous. It doesn't get you likes on social media, and nobody brags about their disciplined 1.5% per game approach. But it's the single most important skill separating long-term winners from the 95% of bettors who lose. Master this, and everything else in your <a href="../bankroll-management.html" style="color:#00ffff;">bankroll management strategy</a> falls into place.</p>
