Even a 60% winner will have weeks where they go 6-14. The question isn't whether you'll face losing streaks. The question is whether you'll handle them correctly or let them destroy your bankroll and your confidence.</p><p>Professional bettors survive downswings because they expect them. They've seen the variance simulations. They know a 10-game losing streak happens to everyone eventually. When it happens, they don't panic. They stick to their process and wait for regression to the mean.</p><h2>Why Downswings Feel Worse Than They Are</h2><p>Losing hurts more than winning feels good. That's not an exaggeration—it's psychology. A $500 loss feels worse than a $500 win feels good, so during downswings, you remember every bad beat and forget the wins that came before.</p><p>This skewed perception makes bettors do stupid things. They question their process. They chase losses. They bet on games they wouldn't normally touch because they're desperate to get even. All of these reactions make the downswing worse.</p><h2>What Causes a Downswing?</h2><p>Sometimes it's pure variance. You're making good bets at good numbers, but the results aren't coming. The underdog you bet at +150 loses by a field goal in overtime. The favorite you bet at -3 wins by 2. Nothing you can do about that except wait it out.</p><p>Sometimes it's a process problem. The market has adjusted to something you were exploiting, or your edge has disappeared for reasons you haven't identified yet. This is why tracking closing line value matters—it tells you whether you're still making +EV bets even when you're losing.</p><h2>How to Handle Downswings</h2><p>First, check your process. Are you still beating the closing line? Are you still finding value? If yes, the downswing is variance. Keep betting. If no, you need to reevaluate what you're doing.</p><p>Second, reduce your unit size if the downswing is severe. If you're down 20% on the season, your bankroll is smaller, so your units should shrink proportionally. Don't keep betting 2% of your starting bankroll when your current bankroll is 20% smaller.</p><p>Third, take a break if you're tilting. If you're making bets out of frustration or desperation, you're not in the right mental state to bet. Walk away for a few days. The games will still be there when you get back.</p><div class="tip-box"><p>Professional bettors don't try to "break out" of downswings by betting more or betting bigger. They trust their long-term edge and keep making the same quality bets at the same disciplined sizing. Eventually, variance evens out. Always does.</p></div><h2>The Long-Term Mindset</h2><p>Betting is a marathon. One bad month doesn't define your career. One bad week doesn't mean your process is broken. You're playing a probabilistic game over thousands of bets, not dozens.</p><p>Winners survive downswings by trusting their process and managing their bankroll conservatively enough that variance can't destroy them. Losers panic, chase, and blow up their roll trying to force a turnaround.</p><div class="back-link"><p><a href="/bankroll-management.html">← Read the Full Bankroll Management Guide</a></p></div></div>
