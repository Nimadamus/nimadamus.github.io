</nav><div class="content-container"><h1>When to Increase Your Unit Size</h1><p>Your bankroll grows. Your unit size should grow with it. But most bettors either increase too fast and give back all their winnings, or never increase at all and leave profits on the table. If you haven't already, start with our <a href="unit-sizing.html" style="color:#00ffff;">unit sizing fundamentals</a> before learning when to scale up.</p><p>The right approach is systematic. Recalculate your unit size regularly based on your current bankroll, not your starting bankroll. This lets you capitalize on winning stretches while protecting gains during losing stretches. If you understand <a href="/bankroll.html" style="color:#00ffff;">the basics of bankroll management</a>, this is the natural next step.</p><p>Here's the thing most people get wrong: they treat unit size increases as a reward for good results. It's not a reward. It's a mathematical recalibration. The moment you start thinking of bigger bets as something you've "earned" through a hot streak, you've already lost the plot. The right triggers for increasing your unit size are bankroll milestones, not emotional momentum.</p>

<h2>The Weekly Recalculation Method</h2><p>Every week, calculate your total available bankroll. If you're betting 2% per game, multiply your current bankroll by 0.02. That's your new unit size. It's that simple, and that discipline is what separates bettors who build wealth from bettors who go on runs and give it all back.</p><p>If your bankroll grows from $5,000 to $5,800, your unit increases from $100 to $116. If it drops to $4,600, your unit drops to $92. You're always betting a consistent percentage, which keeps your <a href="risk-of-ruin.html" style="color:#00ffff;">risk of ruin</a> low regardless of whether you're winning or losing.</p><p>Why weekly instead of daily? Daily recalculations can lead to overreaction. One bad Saturday where you lose four games could drop your unit size significantly, and then one good Sunday brings it right back up. That kind of whiplash creates more problems than it solves. Weekly recalculations smooth out the day-to-day noise and give you a more accurate picture of where your bankroll actually stands.</p><p>Some bettors prefer bi-weekly or monthly recalculations, and that's fine too. The key is picking a schedule and sticking to it. The worst thing you can do is recalculate whenever you feel like it, because "whenever you feel like it" almost always means "right after a big win when you want to bet more."</p>

<h2>Bankroll Growth Milestones: The Right Triggers</h2><p>Instead of recalculating on a fixed schedule, some sharp bettors use bankroll growth milestones as their trigger. The idea is simple: you only increase your unit size when your bankroll crosses a predetermined threshold.</p><p>Here's how to set it up. Start by defining percentage milestones, typically every 20% to 25% of growth above your starting bankroll. If you start with $5,000, your milestones might look like this:</p><p style="padding-left:20px;color:#ddd;"><strong style="color:#FFD700;">Milestone 1:</strong> Bankroll reaches $6,000 (20% growth). Recalculate units based on $6,000.<br/><strong style="color:#FFD700;">Milestone 2:</strong> Bankroll reaches $7,200 (20% growth from $6,000). Recalculate units based on $7,200.<br/><strong style="color:#FFD700;">Milestone 3:</strong> Bankroll reaches $8,640 (20% growth from $7,200). Recalculate units based on $8,640.</p><p>Notice that each milestone is 20% above the previous milestone, not 20% above the starting bankroll. This creates a compounding effect that mirrors the way your bankroll actually grows. And it prevents you from making premature adjustments during temporary upswings that haven't truly stabilized.</p><p>The beauty of milestone-based recalculation is that it forces patience. You don't adjust after every good week. You adjust when you've proven, through sustained profitability, that your bankroll has genuinely grown to a new level.</p>

<h2>Don't Increase After Hot Streaks</h2><p>You win seven in a row. You're up $700. Your instinct is to start betting bigger because you're hot. Don't.</p><p>Hot streaks are variance, not skill. If you start betting $200 per game because you won $700, and then you hit a normal losing streak, you'll give it all back faster than you earned it.</p><p>This is probably the single most dangerous trap in sports betting. It feels so logical in the moment. You're winning, your confidence is sky-high, and you convince yourself that you've cracked the code. But the math doesn't care about your confidence. A 55% bettor who just went 7-0 is still a 55% bettor. The next seven bets don't know about the last seven.</p><p>Increase your unit size based on bankroll growth, not recent results. The weekly recalculation handles this automatically, because your unit grows as your bankroll grows, but it does so gradually and systematically. If you follow the milestone approach, even better. You won't even think about adjusting until you've hit that next threshold.</p><div class="warning-box"><p>The biggest mistake winning bettors make is getting overconfident and increasing unit size too aggressively. They go from $100 to $300 per game after a good month, then lose it all in two weeks when <a href="variance.html" style="color:#ffaaaa;">variance</a> swings the other way. This isn't theoretical. It happens every single day to bettors who are otherwise smart enough to find value in betting lines.</p></div>

<h2>How to Recalculate Your Unit Size (Step by Step)</h2><p>Let's walk through the actual math so there's no confusion. Say you decide on a 2% unit size. Here's the process every time you recalculate:</p><p><strong style="color:#FFD700;">Step 1:</strong> Count your total bankroll. This means money in your sportsbook accounts, any money set aside specifically for betting, and nothing else. Your rent money, your savings, your emergency fund, none of that counts. Only money you've designated as your betting bankroll.</p><p><strong style="color:#FFD700;">Step 2:</strong> Multiply by your unit percentage. If you're at 2%, multiply your total bankroll by 0.02. If you're at 1%, multiply by 0.01. The <a href="/kelly-criterion.html" style="color:#00ffff;">Kelly Criterion</a> can help you figure out the optimal percentage based on your actual edge, but most recreational bettors should stay between 1% and 3%.</p><p><strong style="color:#FFD700;">Step 3:</strong> Round to a clean number. If your math says $117.40, round to $115 or $120. Clean numbers make bet placement easier and prevent you from overthinking every wager.</p><p><strong style="color:#FFD700;">Step 4:</strong> Use that number for every bet until your next recalculation date or milestone. Don't adjust mid-cycle. Don't bump it up because you feel good. Don't drop it because you lost one game. Stick to the plan until the next scheduled recalculation.</p>

<h2>The Danger of Premature Increases</h2><p>Let's say you start with a $5,000 bankroll and a $100 unit (2%). You go 12-6 over the first two weeks. Great results. Your bankroll is now around $5,500. Some bettors look at that and immediately jump their unit to $150 or even $200, thinking they're being "aggressive" or "capitalizing on momentum."</p><p>Here's what actually happens. You increase to $150 per unit. Then you go 8-10 over the next two weeks, a completely normal stretch of variance for a 55% bettor. At $150 per unit, those two extra losses cost you $300 more than they would have at $100. Your bankroll drops back to $4,900, below where you started. And psychologically, you've gone from feeling like a genius to feeling like a loser, all because you increased too fast.</p><p>Had you stayed at $100 units during that 8-10 stretch, your bankroll would have only dropped to about $5,100. Still above your starting point. Still in a position of strength. The difference between $4,900 and $5,100 doesn't sound like much, but one scenario has you demoralized and second-guessing everything, while the other has you calm and sticking to the process.</p><p>Premature increases amplify your losses just as much as they amplify your wins. And because losing streaks feel worse than winning streaks feel good, the psychological damage of premature scaling often leads to even worse decisions down the line.</p>

<h2>The Conservative Scaling Approach</h2><p>Some professional bettors only increase unit size after they've sustained profitability for an extended period. They might wait until their bankroll has been at the new level for a full month before adjusting units.</p><p>This prevents you from increasing units during temporary upswings that reverse quickly. The downside is you leave some profit on the table during genuine growth periods. The upside is you protect gains more conservatively.</p><p>Here's a practical version of this approach: only recalculate your unit size if your bankroll has stayed above a milestone for at least 30 consecutive days. If your bankroll hits $6,000 but drops back to $5,700 two weeks later, you don't recalculate. You wait until it's been at $6,000 or above for a full month. That way you know the growth is real and not just a temporary spike from one lucky weekend.</p><p>This is the approach that most full-time sports bettors use, and for good reason. It prioritizes survival over growth. And in sports betting, survival is everything. You can't compound your edge if you've already blown up your bankroll.</p>

<h2>Scaling Back Down After Drawdowns</h2><p>Nobody wants to talk about this part, but it's just as important as knowing when to scale up. When your bankroll shrinks, your unit size needs to shrink with it. Period. No exceptions. No "I'll just ride it out at the higher unit and make it back."</p><p>The math here works the same way in reverse. If your bankroll drops from $6,000 to $5,000, your 2% unit drops from $120 to $100. And you need to make that adjustment immediately, not at the end of the week, not at the end of the month. Drawdowns don't wait for your recalculation schedule.</p><p>This is where many bettors blow up completely. They had a $6,000 bankroll, were betting $120 per game, hit a rough stretch, and now they're at $4,500 but still betting $120. At that point, each bet represents 2.7% of their bankroll instead of 2%. If the losing streak continues, they're at $3,500 and still betting $120, which is now 3.4% per game. That's a death spiral. The losses get proportionally larger as the bankroll shrinks, accelerating the drawdown until there's nothing left.</p><p>The fix is brutal but simple: the moment your bankroll drops below a milestone, drop your unit size. If you crossed $6,000 and bumped to $120 units, the instant you fall back below $6,000, you go back to $100. No debates. No "one more day at the higher level." Protecting your bankroll during drawdowns is not optional. If you want to understand exactly how dangerous this can get, run the numbers through our <a href="/bankroll-management.html" style="color:#00ffff;">bankroll management guide</a> and look at what happens when you don't scale down.</p>

<h2>Specific Bankroll Thresholds to Use</h2><p>If you want a ready-made framework, here's one that works for most bettors at different bankroll levels. These thresholds assume a 2% unit size, but you can adjust the percentages to match your own risk tolerance.</p><p style="padding-left:20px;color:#ddd;"><strong style="color:#FFD700;">$1,000 bankroll:</strong> $20 units. Recalculate at $1,250 (new unit: $25).<br/><strong style="color:#FFD700;">$2,500 bankroll:</strong> $50 units. Recalculate at $3,125 (new unit: $62).<br/><strong style="color:#FFD700;">$5,000 bankroll:</strong> $100 units. Recalculate at $6,250 (new unit: $125).<br/><strong style="color:#FFD700;">$10,000 bankroll:</strong> $200 units. Recalculate at $12,500 (new unit: $250).<br/><strong style="color:#FFD700;">$25,000 bankroll:</strong> $500 units. Recalculate at $31,250 (new unit: $625).</p><p>Each threshold represents a 25% growth milestone. You don't touch your unit size until you've grown your bankroll by a full quarter. And if you drop back below the threshold, you immediately return to the previous unit size.</p><p>Notice how the actual dollar amounts of the increases get larger as your bankroll grows, but the percentage stays constant. That's the power of percentage-based bet sizing. It keeps your risk consistent regardless of the size of your bankroll, and it lets compound growth do the heavy lifting over time.</p>

<h2>When to Lock In Profits</h2><p>If you double your bankroll, consider withdrawing a portion and treating it as realized profit. Some bettors withdraw 25-50% of gains above their starting bankroll and only bet with the remainder.</p><p>This means if you start with $5,000 and grow to $10,000, you might withdraw $2,500 and bet with $7,500 going forward. Your unit size increases because your betting bankroll increased, but you've locked in real profit that variance can't take back.</p><p>This is a psychological safety net as much as a financial one. Knowing that you've already banked $2,500 in real, spendable profit takes the pressure off. You're playing with house money on the extra $2,500 in your betting account, and your original $5,000 is intact. That kind of mental clarity makes you a better bettor because you're not making decisions from a place of desperation or fear.</p><p>A good rule of thumb: every time your bankroll doubles, withdraw 25% of the total and reset your unit calculations based on what's left. You'll grow slower than someone who never withdraws, but you'll also never experience the gut-wrenching feeling of watching a $20,000 bankroll evaporate back to $5,000 because you never took anything off the table.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2><p>The best bet sizing strategy combines everything above into a simple, repeatable system. Pick your unit percentage (1% to 3% for most bettors). Set your recalculation milestones at every 20-25% of bankroll growth. Only increase units when you've sustained that growth for at least two to four weeks. Scale back down immediately during drawdowns. And withdraw a portion of profits every time you double up.</p><p>It's not glamorous. It won't make you feel like a high-roller after one good weekend. But it's the approach that every successful long-term bettor uses in some form. The bettors who build real, lasting bankrolls aren't the ones making the biggest bets. They're the ones making the most disciplined bets, at the right size, at the right time, with a system that protects them when things go wrong.</p><p>Your unit size isn't just a number. It's the bridge between your edge and your bankroll. Get it right, and compound growth does the work for you. Get it wrong, and even a winning strategy can leave you broke.</p>
