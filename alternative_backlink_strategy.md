## âœ… Alternative Strategies That Work

### 1. **Create Your Own Subreddit**
**r/BetLegendPicks** (or similar)
- You control everything
- Can't get banned

**How to grow it:**
- Post consistently
- Share on Twitter: "Daily picks now on r/BetLegendPicks"

### 2. **Twitter/X (Can't be banned as easily)**
Focus HEAVILY on Twitter:

### 8. **YouTube (Can't really get banned)**
Create videos:

### 10. **Guest Posts on Small Blogs**
Target smaller betting blogs:

### 12. **Start Fresh on New Platforms**
If you want Reddit again:

- Age it for 30+ days
- Build karma on NON-betting subreddits first
- Post in r/sports, r/baseball (not sportsbook)
- Once established, share picks carefully
- Use different posting style/tone
- Never mention betlegendpicks immediately

## ðŸš« Why Getting Banned Happened (To Avoid Next Time)

Common reasons:

- Comment/engage for weeks before sharing links
- Provide value without links first
- Share picks, then casually mention "full analysis on my site"

1. **Your own platforms** (can't get banned)
2. **Twitter** (huge audience, hard to ban)
3. **Medium/Quora** (high authority, link-friendly)
4. **YouTube** (visual content, untapped)
