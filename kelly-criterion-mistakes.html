    <h1>7 Common Kelly Criterion Mistakes That Destroy Bankrolls</h1>
    <p class="meta">The errors that turn a winning strategy into a losing one</p>

    <p>The Kelly Criterion is mathematically sound. Used correctly, it optimizes long-term bankroll growth. But "used correctly" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence.</p>

    <p>In practice, most bettors who try Kelly make critical mistakes that undermine the strategy entirely. Some of these mistakes cause slow bleeding. Others can wipe out a bankroll in weeks. Here are the most common errors and how to avoid them.</p>

    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h3>Mistake 1: Overestimating Your Edge</h3>
        <p>This is the most common and most damaging mistake. You think you have a 56% chance of winning, but your actual probability is 52%. That 4% difference might seem small, but it means you are betting nearly twice as much as you should.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The problem is psychological. We are naturally overconfident in our analysis. We remember our winning picks more vividly than our losers. We convince ourselves that our research gives us an edge we do not actually have.</p>
        <div class="fix-box">
            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Track every bet you make for at least 100 bets before using Kelly. Use your actual historical win rate, not your estimated win rate. And even then, use fractional Kelly to protect against remaining overconfidence.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h3>Mistake 2: Using Full Kelly</h3>
        <p>Full Kelly is mathematically optimal only if your edge estimate is perfectly accurate. Since it never is, full Kelly almost always leads to overbetting. The volatility becomes unbearable, and a few bad beats can devastate your bankroll.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Professional bettors, including those who have made millions using Kelly, almost universally use fractional Kelly. Typically half Kelly or less.</p>
        <div class="fix-box">
            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Start with quarter Kelly. Move to half Kelly only after you have validated your edge over 200+ bets. Never use full Kelly unless you have a statistically proven edge over thousands of bets.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h3>Mistake 3: Ignoring Volatility</h3>
        <p>Kelly tells you the bet size that maximizes long-term growth. But "long-term" can mean thousands of bets. In the short term, even optimal Kelly betting experiences significant swings. If you cannot stomach a 30% drawdown, you should not be using full Kelly.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Many bettors abandon Kelly after a bad week, right before the strategy would have recovered. They confuse normal variance with a flawed approach.</p>
        <div class="fix-box">
            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Understand that drawdowns are normal. Use fractional Kelly to reduce volatility to a level you can tolerate. Do not abandon the strategy during a losing streak if your long-term edge is still valid.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h3>Mistake 4: Not Updating Your Bankroll</h3>
        <p>Kelly tells you to bet a percentage of your bankroll. That means your bet size should change as your bankroll changes. If you start with $1,000 and grow to $1,500, your bets should increase. If you drop to $700, your bets should decrease.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Some bettors calculate Kelly once and then bet the same dollar amount forever. This defeats the entire purpose of Kelly, which is to scale bets based on current bankroll.</p>
        <div class="fix-box">
            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Recalculate your bet size before every bet, or at minimum, recalculate weekly based on your current bankroll.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h3>Mistake 5: Betting Correlated Events</h3>
        <p>Kelly assumes each bet is independent. But if you are betting on three games on the same NFL Sunday, those outcomes are not truly independent. Weather, scheduling, and general variance can cause underdogs or favorites to win in bunches.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">If you apply Kelly to each game individually without accounting for correlation, you are effectively betting more than Kelly recommends in aggregate.</p>
        <div class="fix-box">
            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Reduce your Kelly fraction when betting multiple correlated events. If you are betting five games on the same day, consider using quarter Kelly instead of half Kelly to account for the combined risk.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h3>Mistake 6: Using Kelly Without an Edge</h3>
        <p>Kelly only works if you have a genuine edge. If your true win probability equals the break-even probability implied by the odds, Kelly will tell you to bet zero. If your probability is actually worse than break-even, Kelly will give you a negative number, meaning do not bet.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Some bettors use Kelly on every bet they make, regardless of whether they have an edge. This turns a bankroll management tool into a gambling accelerator.</p>
        <div class="fix-box">
            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Only use Kelly on bets where you have a genuine, quantifiable edge. If Kelly returns a negative or near-zero percentage, that is the formula telling you there is no bet to make.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mistake-box">
        <h3>Mistake 7: Exceeding 5% of Bankroll</h3>
        <p>Even when Kelly recommends a large bet, you should cap your maximum bet at 5% of your bankroll. Heavy favorites can produce Kelly recommendations of 10%, 15%, or even higher. But upsets happen, and a single loss at 15% of bankroll is devastating.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The 5% cap is a safety valve that protects you from the tail risks that Kelly does not fully account for.</p>
        <div class="fix-box">
            <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Never bet more than 5% of your bankroll on any single game, regardless of what the Kelly formula recommends. This is non-negotiable.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>The Common Thread</h2>

    <p>Most Kelly mistakes come from the same root cause: treating the formula as more precise than it is. Kelly is a guide, not a commandment. It requires accurate inputs to produce accurate outputs, and those inputs are always estimates.</p>

    <p>The bettors who use Kelly successfully treat it with appropriate humility. They use fractional Kelly. They track their actual results. They adjust their estimates based on data. They understand that the formula is only as good as the probability estimates they feed into it.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>You can avoid most of these mistakes by starting conservative and adjusting based on actual results. Use the <a href="kelly-criterion.html">Kelly calculator</a> with quarter or half Kelly, track your bets rigorously, and let your actual win rate guide your probability estimates over time.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Biggest Mistake of All</h2>

    <p>The biggest mistake is not using Kelly at all when you do have an edge. Flat betting at 1% per game when Kelly says you should be betting 3% means you are leaving significant long-term growth on the table.</p>

    <p>The goal is not to avoid Kelly. The goal is to use it wisely. Start conservative, validate your edge, and scale up as your confidence in your probability estimates grows. That is how professionals build bankrolls over time.</p>

    <p>If you want to see how different approaches perform over hundreds of bets, you can <a href="kelly-simulation.html">run a simulation</a> comparing full Kelly, fractional Kelly, and flat betting. Watching the volatility differences firsthand makes the case for fractional Kelly impossible to ignore.</p>
