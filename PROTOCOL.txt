BETLEGEND PICKS - CONTENT PROTOCOL SHEET

CRITICAL: ALL STATISTICS MUST BE VERIFIED
This is business-critical. Unverified stats damage credibility and revenue.

STATISTICS VERIFICATION RULES:
------------------------------

1. USER-PROVIDED DATA (PRIMARY SOURCE)
   - Always use exact stats from user's messages as foundation
   - Copy numbers exactly as provided
   - Never round, estimate, or approximate user data

2. ADDITIONAL STATISTICS (DEEP DIVE CONTENT)
   - User confirms capability to find accurate info - use this
   - MUST verify through web search BEFORE including
   - If unable to verify a stat, DO NOT include it
   - When in doubt, leave it out
   - Every number must be traceable to source

3. PROHIBITED ACTIONS
   - NEVER make up statistics
   - NEVER estimate or guess numbers
   - NEVER extrapolate from partial data
   - NEVER assume records or percentages
   - NEVER calculate stats without verified inputs

4. CONTENT POSTING RULES
   - Only add posts, never overwrite or delete existing content
   - Insert new posts at the top (before existing posts)
   - Preserve all existing content exactly as is
   - Use verified stats and real information only
   - Make content in-depth, valid, human-sounding, informative, excellent

5. VERIFICATION PROCESS
   Before posting ANY content:
   ✓ Check every team record is verified
   ✓ Check every ATS mark is verified
   ✓ Check every percentage is verified
   ✓ Check every consensus pick count is verified
   ✓ If adding deep dive stats, verify through search first

6. IF UNCERTAIN
   - Ask the user for clarification
   - Do not guess or fill in blanks
   - Better to ask than to post wrong information

REMEMBER: Every fake stat damages the business. Accuracy is non-negotiable.
