## Reddit Rules to Follow

### ✅ DO:

- Engage with comments (reply to questions)
- Post during peak hours (8-11am ET, 5-8pm ET)
- Use proper flair when required
- Include disclaimers ("not financial advice", "bet responsibly")
- Share both wins AND losses (transparency builds trust)
- Give value first, link second

### ❌ DON'T:
- Spam the same content across multiple subs
- Post affiliate links without disclosure
- Make it sound like an ad
- Post only when you're winning
- Ignore comments
- Post during off-hours
- Ask for money/subscriptions immediately
- Copy/paste the exact same post

## Content Types That Work

### 1. Daily Picks Posts (Best for r/sportsbook)
Format:
```
Title: [SPORT] Daily Picks - [DATE] - [RECORD]
Body: Analysis with data, link to full breakdown
```

### 2. Model/System Explanation Posts
Share how your model works (builds credibility)

### 3. Results/Transparency Posts
Monthly results, verified records (link to your records page)

### 4. Strategy/Education Posts
Teach betting concepts (Kelly Criterion, EV, etc.) - link to your calculators

### 5. AMA (Ask Me Anything)
Once you have credibility, host an AMA

## Posting Schedule

- 9:00 AM ET - Post to r/sportsbook with MLB/NFL picks

### 3x per Week:
- Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday - Post to r/sportsbetting

## Success Metrics

Track these:
- Upvotes per post (aim for 10+ consistently)
- Comments (engagement)
- Click-through rate to your site
- New subscribers/followers

## Red Flags to Avoid

Reddit will ban you if:
- Account is too new with no karma (build karma first)
- Only post links to your site (spam filter)
- Don't engage with community
- Break subreddit rules

## Building Karma First

Before heavy promotion:
1. Comment on other people's picks (add value)
2. Share analysis in comments
3. Post picks WITHOUT links first
4. Build to 500+ karma before aggressive linking
