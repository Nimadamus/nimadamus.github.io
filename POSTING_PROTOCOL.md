# BetLegend Posting Protocol

### SESSION VERIFICATION CODE: POSTING-RULES-ACTIVE

## MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL POSTS

This protocol MUST be followed for every blog post and news article uploaded to betlegendpicks.com.

---

## ⛔⛔⛔ ZERO TOLERANCE: NO PLACEHOLDER CONTENT. EVER. ⛔⛔⛔

### PERMANENTLY LOCKED - DECEMBER 20, 2025

**EVERY GAME on sports pages MUST have REAL, substantive written analysis.**

### BANNED PLACEHOLDER CONTENT (ABSOLUTE BAN):
- ❌ "Matchup analysis coming soon"
- ❌ "Analysis coming soon"
- ❌ "Preview coming soon"
- ❌ "[Team] vs [Team]" with no analysis
- ❌ Single-sentence game descriptions
- ❌ ANY one-liner placeholder text
- ❌ Template filler content
- ❌ Generic text that could apply to any game

### MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS PER GAME:
- ✅ **2-3 paragraphs minimum** of substantive written analysis
- ✅ Specific details about THIS matchup (players, stats, storylines)
- ✅ Real context (team records, recent form, key injuries)
- ✅ Something unique that makes this game interesting
- ✅ Human-sounding editorial content, not robotic filler

### THE RULE IS ABSOLUTE:
```
IF a game exists on the page → IT MUST HAVE REAL WRITTEN ANALYSIS
IF you cannot write real analysis → DO NOT ADD THE GAME
BETTER to have fewer games with quality content than all games with placeholder garbage
```

### WHAT HAPPENED (December 19, 2025):
Sports pages were published with one-liner placeholders like "Matchup analysis coming soon" for every game. This is UNACCEPTABLE. Users saw empty content shells instead of real analysis. This destroyed the professional appearance of the site.

### THE FIX:
Every game MUST have substantive content. If time constraints exist:
1. Cover fewer games with real analysis rather than all games with placeholders
2. Research and write genuine content for each game included
3. Add remaining games later with proper analysis

### ENFORCEMENT:
- Any page found with placeholder content must be fixed IMMEDIATELY
- The "coming soon" pattern is PERMANENTLY BANNED
- This rule overrides any time pressure to publish quickly

**Quality over quantity. Always.**

## ⛔⛔⛔ NO EM DASHES IN NEWS OR BLOG POSTS ⛔⛔⛔

### PERMANENTLY LOCKED - JANUARY 15, 2026

**Em dashes (—) are a telltale sign of AI-generated content. NEVER use them.**

### BANNED:
- ❌ Em dashes (—) anywhere in the article
- ❌ "Twenty-six individuals—including 22 players—were charged"
- ❌ "The investigation—which lasted three years—revealed..."
- ❌ Any sentence with em dashes

### USE INSTEAD:
- ✅ Periods to separate thoughts
- ✅ Commas for natural pauses
- ✅ Rewrite sentences to flow naturally
- ✅ Parentheses only when absolutely necessary

### EXAMPLE:
```
WRONG (AI-sounding):
"Antonio Blakeney—a former Bulls guard who played 76 games—allegedly
orchestrated the scheme."

RIGHT (Human-sounding):
"Antonio Blakeney, the former Bulls guard who played 76 games, allegedly
orchestrated the scheme."

EVEN BETTER:
"Antonio Blakeney allegedly orchestrated the scheme. The former Bulls
guard played 76 games in the NBA from 2017 to 2019."
```

### WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Em dashes are overused by AI models
- Human writers rarely use em dashes this frequently
- Readers can spot AI content by the dash patterns
- Professional journalism uses them sparingly, not constantly

### THE RULE:
```
BEFORE PUBLISHING: Search the article for "—"
IF any em dashes found → REWRITE those sentences
The article should have ZERO em dashes
```

**Em dashes = AI smell. Remove them. Always.**

---

## ⛔⛔⛔ CRITICAL: COVER ALL GAMES ON THE BOARD ⛔⛔⛔

### FULL SLATE COVERAGE IS MANDATORY

**When creating a slate post (NFL, NBA, NHL, NCAAB, MLB), you MUST cover EVERY SINGLE GAME scheduled for that date.**

| Sport | Typical Full Slate |
|-------|-------------------|
| **NFL** | 14-16 games (Thursday + Sunday + Monday) |
| **NBA** | 8-15 games depending on the day |
| **NHL** | 8-14 games depending on the day |
| **NCAAB** | 50-100+ games (cover at least all ranked matchups + conference games) |
| **MLB** | 15 games during regular season |

### THE RULE IS ABSOLUTE

```
IF the NFL has 16 games on Sunday → YOU COVER ALL 16 GAMES
IF the NBA has 12 games tonight → YOU COVER ALL 12 GAMES
IF the NHL has 10 games → YOU COVER ALL 10 GAMES
```

### WHY THIS MATTERS

- Users come to BetLegend for COMPLETE coverage
- Partial slates (7 out of 16 games) look LAZY and UNPROFESSIONAL
- Competitors cover full slates - we must do the same
- One missing game could be the game a user is looking for

### VERIFICATION PROCESS

1. **FIRST**: Search ESPN/official schedule for the EXACT date
2. **COUNT**: Every single game scheduled
3. **LIST**: All games before starting to write
4. **VERIFY**: You have analysis for EVERY game before publishing

### NO PARTIAL SLATES. EVER.

**If you cannot cover ALL games, DO NOT publish until you can.**

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: 100% VERIFICATION OR DON'T POST ⚠️

### ONE FALSE CLAIM DESTROYS CREDIBILITY

**NOTHING goes live without 100% verification. NOTHING.**

Before ANY content is posted to BetLegend, you MUST verify:

| Category | What to Verify | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Players** | Current team, injury status, trade history | Players change teams constantly - Kevin Durant to Rockets, Marner to Vegas, etc. |
| **Stats** | PPG, APG, RPG, yards, TDs, goals, assists | One wrong stat makes readers question everything |
| **Advanced Analytics** | ORtg, DRtg, DVOA, xG%, Corsi, EPA | These are the backbone of credible analysis |
| **Records** | W-L, ATS record, home/road splits | Easy to verify, inexcusable to get wrong |
| **Rankings** | League rankings, conference standings | Changes daily - always search current data |
| **Trends** | Win streaks, ATS trends, O/U trends | Must have specific numbers, not guesses |
| **Injuries** | Exact injury type (ACL vs Achilles), status | Tatum has ACHILLES not ACL - details matter |
| **Historical Claims** | Championships, records, milestones | OKC = 2025 NBA Champs, Panthers = back-to-back |
| **Betting Lines** | Current spread, total, moneyline | Lines move - verify before posting |
| **Game Details** | Date, time, venue, broadcast | Simple facts that must be correct |

### THE VERIFICATION RULE IS ABSOLUTE

```
IF you cannot verify it with a search → DO NOT INCLUDE IT
IF you're "pretty sure" but can't confirm → DO NOT INCLUDE IT
IF your memory says one thing but you can't find a source → DO NOT INCLUDE IT
IF the information is outdated → DO NOT INCLUDE IT
```

### WHY THIS MATTERS

- One wrong player-team association = readers lose trust
- One fabricated stat = entire article becomes suspect
- One incorrect injury detail = you look like you don't do research
- One made-up trend = credibility destroyed permanently

**The internet remembers everything. False information spreads. Your reputation is on the line with every single claim.**

### VERIFICATION IS NOT OPTIONAL

This is not a suggestion. This is not a guideline. This is an ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT.

Every player. Every stat. Every trend. Every record. Every injury. Every analytical claim. Every historical reference. Every betting line. Every single piece of information.

**100% verified or it doesn't go live. Period.**

---

## ⛔ CRITICAL WARNING: FEATURED GAME LINKS MUST BE UPDATED DAILY ⛔

### BROKEN LINKS = BROKEN SITE

**EVERY TIME a new Featured Game of the Day is posted, ALL 300+ pages on the site MUST be updated.**

This is NOT optional. This is NOT something to "get around to later." This happens IMMEDIATELY.

### THE DECEMBER 8, 2025 INCIDENT

On December 8, 2025, users clicking "Featured Game of the Day" were taken to the Detroit vs Dallas game from December 4th - FOUR DAYS OLD. The actual featured game was Eagles vs Chargers. This is UNACCEPTABLE.

### THE RULE

```
NEW Featured Game posted → IMMEDIATELY run batch update script → PUSH → VERIFY LIVE
```

**There is NO excuse for outdated Featured Game links. NONE.**

### HOW TO UPDATE (Takes 30 seconds)

```python
# Run this EVERY TIME a new Featured Game is created
import os, re
REPO = r'C:\Users\Nima\nimadamus.github.io'
NEW = 'featured-game-of-the-day-pageXX.html'  # ← UPDATE THIS NUMBER

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(REPO):
    dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d != '.git']
    for f in files:
        if f.endswith('.html'):
            path = os.path.join(root, f)
            with open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as file:
                c = file.read()
            orig = c
            c = re.sub(r'featured-game-of-the-day-page\d+\.html', NEW, c)
            c = re.sub(r'featured-game-of-the-day\.html', NEW, c)
            if c != orig:
                with open(path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                    file.write(c)
```

### DAILY CHECKLIST

- [ ] New Featured Game created? → Run script immediately
- [ ] Script updated all files? → Verify count
- [ ] **Calendar data updated?** → Add entry to `featured-games-data.js`

**If the Featured Game link ever shows an old game, someone screwed up. Don't let it be you.**

### CALENDAR AUTO-UPDATE (NEW - December 2025)

The Featured Game Calendar now auto-populates from `featured-games-data.js`. When creating a new featured game:

**Add ONE line to `featured-games-data.js`:**
```javascript

- Show the latest game in stats bar

**NO MORE manual calendar HTML editing required!**

## 1. ACCURACY & VERIFICATION

### ⛔ ABSOLUTE RULE: 100% ONLINE VERIFICATION REQUIRED ⛔

**EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2025 - ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY**

**EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF INFORMATION MUST BE VERIFIED WITH AN ONLINE SEARCH BEFORE POSTING. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

This includes but is not limited to:
- Every number (stats, records, scores, percentages, rankings)
- Every player name and their current team
- Every stat (PPG, APG, RPG, goals, assists, yards, touchdowns, etc.)
- Every trend (winning streaks, ATS records, head-to-head history)
- Every matchup detail
- Every location (arena, stadium, city)
- Every date and time
- Every injury (type, status, timeline)
- Every trade or roster move
- Every historical claim
- Every championship or award reference

### THE VERIFICATION PROCESS

**BEFORE writing ANY claim, you MUST:**
1. Run a WebSearch to verify the information
2. Find a reliable source confirming the fact
3. Only THEN include it in the content

**If you cannot verify something with a search:**
- DO NOT INCLUDE IT
- DO NOT GUESS
- DO NOT USE MEMORY
- Either find a verifiable alternative or leave it out entirely

### WHY THIS RULE EXISTS

This rule was implemented after repeated incidents of fabricated information being posted, including:
- Fake player statistics
- Wrong team records
- Incorrect division standings
- Made-up historical claims
- Future dates presented as past events

**One false claim destroys credibility. This site's reputation depends on accuracy.**

### VERIFICATION SOURCES
- WebSearch for current stats and news
- ESPN, official league websites for schedules and standings
- Team official websites for rosters
- User-provided information (considered verified)

### CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATING THIS RULE
- Content with unverified information damages the site's credibility
- All unverified claims must be removed immediately upon discovery
- There is NO acceptable excuse for posting fabricated information

---

## 1A. MANDATORY SLATE POST VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: COMPLETE THIS CHECKLIST BEFORE WRITING ANY SLATE POST ⚠️

**This section was added after errors were made claiming "5-game slates" when there were actually 15 games. This is UNACCEPTABLE and damages credibility.**

### STEP 1: VERIFY TOTAL GAME COUNT (MANDATORY)
Before writing ANY slate post, you MUST:
1. Search ESPN/official league schedule for the EXACT date
2. COUNT every single game scheduled for that date
3. WRITE DOWN the total number of games
4. NEVER use phrases like "full slate" or "[X]-game slate" until you have verified the exact count
5. If search results are incomplete, search AGAIN with different terms

**Example Searches Required:**
- "NBA schedule November 26 2025 all games"
- "NHL schedule November 26 2025 complete"
- "College basketball November 26 2025 full schedule"

### STEP 2: VERIFY EVERY PLAYER-TEAM ASSOCIATION (MANDATORY)
Before mentioning ANY player, you MUST verify they currently play for that team:
- [ ] Search "[Player Name] [Team Name] 2025 roster"
- [ ] Confirm they were not traded, released, or injured out for season
- [ ] If player was traded in 2025, verify the CURRENT team

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Players traded mid-season (e.g., Kevin Durant to Rockets, Brandon Ingram to Raptors, Mitch Marner to Vegas)
- Players with season-ending injuries still listed on old rosters
- Assuming a player is still with their 2024 team

### STEP 3: VERIFY ALL INJURIES (MANDATORY)
Before mentioning ANY injury, you MUST:
- [ ] Search "[Player Name] injury November 2025"
- [ ] Verify the EXACT injury type (ACL vs Achilles, knee vs ankle, etc.)
- [ ] Verify current status (out, questionable, probable)
- [ ] Verify expected return timeline if mentioned

**Recent Examples of Injury Errors:**
- Jayson Tatum has an ACHILLES injury, NOT ACL
- Tyrese Haliburton has an ACHILLES injury from 2025 Finals
- Connor Hellebuyck - knee surgery, 4-6 weeks (November 2025)
- Fred VanVleet - torn ACL, out for 2025-26 season

### STEP 4: VERIFY ALL TEAM RECORDS (MANDATORY)
Before stating ANY team record:
- [ ] Search "[Team Name] record November 2025"
- [ ] Cross-reference with official standings
- [ ] If exact record unavailable, use general terms ("struggling," "hot streak") instead of specific numbers
- [ ] NEVER guess a record - verify or omit

### STEP 5: VERIFY ALL STATISTICS (MANDATORY)
Before citing ANY player stats:
- [ ] Search "[Player Name] stats 2025-26 season"
- [ ] Verify PPG, RPG, APG, or other metrics from official sources
- [ ] Round to one decimal place and use approximate language if needed
- [ ] If stats vary by source, use the most conservative/common number

### STEP 6: VERIFY CHAMPIONSHIP/HISTORICAL CLAIMS (MANDATORY)
Before stating any championship or historical information:
- [ ] Search "[Team Name] championship [year]"
- [ ] Verify titles, streaks, records are accurate
- [ ] Example: OKC Thunder ARE 2025 NBA Champions (beat Pacers in 7 games)
- [ ] Example: Florida Panthers ARE back-to-back Stanley Cup champions (2024, 2025)

### SLATE POST FINAL CHECKLIST

**BEFORE hitting save/commit on ANY slate post:**

- [ ] I verified the EXACT number of games on the schedule
- [ ] I covered ALL games in the slate (not 33%, not 50% - ALL of them)
- [ ] I verified every player mentioned is on the correct team
- [ ] I verified every injury type and status mentioned
- [ ] I verified every team record mentioned
- [ ] I verified every statistic mentioned
- [ ] I did NOT make up ANY information
- [ ] I did NOT assume ANY information from memory
- [ ] I searched and verified EVERYTHING

### IF IN DOUBT

If you cannot verify information:
1. DO NOT INCLUDE IT
2. Use general language instead of specific claims
3. Ask the user to provide/verify the information
4. It is better to have LESS content that is 100% accurate than MORE content with errors

**Remember: One false claim destroys credibility. Every fact must be verified.**

## 1B. MANDATORY ADVANCED STATS & BETTING TRENDS

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL ANALYSIS MUST BE DATA-DRIVEN WITH VERIFIED NUMBERS ⚠️

**EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 3, 2025 - ZERO TOLERANCE FOR CONJECTURE**

Every game analysis MUST include VERIFIED advanced statistics with SPECIFIC NUMBERS from trusted sources. NO OPINIONS OR GUESSES. ALL NUMBERS MUST BE SOURCED AND VERIFIED.

**THE DIFFERENCE:**

- Line movement if significant (e.g., "Line moved from -6.5 to -7.5")

### ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS REQUIRED

Every game analysis MUST include:
1. **The Matchup Edge:** Identify specific statistical advantages (e.g., "Denver's 125.7 ORtg vs Indiana's 122.3 DRtg creates a +3.4 efficiency gap")
2. **Key Number Analysis:** Why the spread matters (e.g., "7 is a key number in basketball, hitting X% of games")
3. **Trend Convergence:** Multiple trends pointing same direction (e.g., "ATS record + O/U trend + head-to-head history all favor...")
4. **Pace Analysis:** How pace affects totals (e.g., "Both teams in top 10 in pace, expect 230+ total")
5. **Rest/Schedule Spots:** Back-to-backs, travel, rest advantages with specific context

### VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR STATS

3. Verify player stats are current (within last 1-2 days)
4. Include league rankings to provide context (e.g., "25.0% PP, 5th in NHL")
5. Note injury impacts with specific player names and replacement options
6. **NEVER USE MEMORY** - Always search to verify even if you think you know the stat

### EXAMPLES OF PROPER DATA-DRIVEN ANALYSIS

**EXCELLENT:**
"Denver enters with the NBA's best offensive rating at 125.7 points per 100 possessions (1st), while Indiana allows 118.6 points per 100 (22nd) - a +7.1 efficiency differential. The Nuggets are 12-7 ATS this season (63.2%), including 8-3 ATS as road favorites. The OVER has hit in 11 of Denver's 19 games (57.9%), and with Indiana's pace (99.1, 8th in NBA) creating extra possessions, the 235.5 total looks live. Jokic's 29.0/12.8/11.1 stat line leads all players in PER (32.1) and BPM (+12.4)."

**GOOD:**
"The Stars are averaging 3.37 goals per game (3rd in NHL, 91 GF) while allowing just 2.56 goals against (7th, 69 GA). Their power play is operating at 33.3%, ranking 2nd in the entire league. At 5v5, Dallas owns a 52.1% Corsi For and 51.8% xG%, indicating sustainable possession dominance."

**UNACCEPTABLE:**
"The Stars have been playing great hockey and their offense is clicking."
"Denver's offense should dominate Indiana's weak defense."
"This feels like a good spot for the Nuggets."

  </div>
</article>
```

### EXAMPLE SPORTS PAGE ARTICLE (NBA):

```
Lakers @ Celtics - Sunday, 3:30 PM ET | TD Garden

This is the rivalry that defines NBA history. The Lakers roll into Boston
riding a three-game winning streak, with LeBron James looking like he's
turned back the clock. At 40 years old, the man is averaging 25 points
and 8 assists over his last five games. Classic LeBron.

The Lakers have been dominant on the road lately, going 5-2 in their
last seven away games. Their defensive intensity has improved since
the coaching staff made adjustments to their switching scheme. Anthony
Davis anchoring the paint has been the difference.

Boston comes in as the defending champions with a chip on their shoulder.
The Celtics lost their last two home games and need to make a statement.
Jaylen Brown has been sensational, averaging 27 points over his last
ten games, while the supporting cast has stepped up with consistent
three-point shooting.

These two franchises have met 312 times, with Boston holding a slight
edge historically. But in the modern era, it's anyone's game when these
two juggernauts collide. The last three meetings have been decided by
single digits.

Watch for the battle on the boards. Whoever controls the glass will
likely control the game. The Lakers have been out-rebounding opponents
by 4.5 per game lately, but Boston's small-ball lineup creates mismatches
that can offset that advantage.
```

**NOTE:** Stats can be mentioned IN the text naturally, but should NOT be displayed in tables/grids on sports pages. That's what Handicapping Hub is for.

---

### ⛔ BANNED TEMPLATE PHRASES - NEVER USE THESE ⛔

**EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 14, 2025 - ZERO TOLERANCE**

The following phrases are BANNED from all sports page content. They are lazy, template garbage that makes content sound robotic:

**NEVER WRITE:**
- ❌ "This is essentially a pick'em" (ESPECIALLY with a 3-point spread - 3 is the most common margin of victory in NFL)
- ❌ "Sharp money has been moving on this game"
- ❌ "This matchup has trap game written all over it"
- ❌ "Vegas sees these teams as evenly matched"
- ❌ "Line movement closer to game time could reveal additional value"
- ❌ "Sometimes the obvious play is the right one. Sometimes it isn't."
- ❌ "Circle this matchup on your calendar"
- ❌ "This game could be more interesting than the spread suggests"
- ❌ "The numbers tell an interesting story"
- ❌ "Here's a game that deserves your attention"
- ❌ "Both teams come into this with something to prove"
- ❌ "The value might not be where the public thinks"
- ❌ "This game deserves a deeper look before making any decisions"
- ❌ "Sharp bettors are paying attention to this one for a reason"
- ❌ Any generic placeholder that could apply to any game

**INSTEAD, WRITE:**
- ✅ Specific analysis about THIS matchup with real details
- ✅ Human-sounding observations that show you actually watched/know these teams
- ✅ Commentary that could ONLY apply to this specific game
- ✅ Actual opinions and analysis, not filler phrases
- ✅ Stats with context explaining why they matter for THIS game

**EXAMPLE OF BANNED CONTENT:**
```
"This is essentially a pick'em with the spread at -3. Vegas sees these teams as evenly matched. Sharp money has been moving on this game. Line movement closer to game time could reveal additional value."
```

**EXAMPLE OF ACCEPTABLE CONTENT:**
```
"Baltimore laying 3 on the road is significant - 3 is the most common margin of victory in the NFL (field goal). This spread says the Ravens should win, but only by a score. With Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' rushing attack facing a Giants defense that's allowed 4.8 yards per carry, Baltimore controls the clock and grinds this out. But can they cover 3 on the road? That's the $64,000 question."
```

**THE STANDARD:** Every game analysis must be written as if a knowledgeable sports fan is explaining the matchup to a friend. It must sound HUMAN, be SPECIFIC to the game, and contain REAL ANALYSIS - not template filler.

### BLOG POSTS (blog-pageX.html)
**Purpose:** Official picks with specific recommendations

Blog posts contain:
- ❌ Picks or predictions
- ❌ "Take [Team]" language
- ❌ "I'm betting..." or "My pick is..."
- ❌ Verdict sections
- ❌ Explicit gambling recommendations

**BLOG POSTS (blog-page*.html):**

These pages ARE for picks. They contain:
- ✅ Everything from sports pages PLUS
- ✅ Explicit picks with lines (e.g., "Lakers -4.5")
- ✅ Verdict sections with final pick
- ✅ "Take [Team]" language
- ✅ Conviction and gambling recommendations

### SPORTS PAGE WRITING STYLE

**DO write like this:**
"The matchup favors Denver's elite offense against Indiana's struggling defense. The efficiency gap of +7.1 points per 100 possessions is significant. Denver's 8-3 ATS record as road favorites and the OVER hitting in 11 of 19 games creates an interesting narrative for bettors to consider."

**DON'T write like this:**
"Take Denver here. The Nuggets are the play tonight. I'm betting the Nuggets -6.5."

### TONE FOR SPORTS PAGES

- Present data and let readers draw conclusions
- Use analytical, informative language
- Be enthusiastic about the matchups and stats
- Sound human and conversational, not robotic
- Provide context and insights without explicit picks
- Phrases like "creates value," "interesting spot," "worth monitoring" are acceptable
- Phrases like "my pick," "take this," "bet this" are NOT acceptable

## 1B. MANDATORY POST-CREATION PROOFREADING

### ⛔ NEVER SKIP THIS STEP ⛔

**After creating ANY content, you MUST proofread and verify:**

### Verification Checklist:

1. **Every Stat Must Be Verified**
   - Team records (W-L)
   - Player statistics (PPG, RPG, APG, etc.)
   - Betting records (ATS, O/U percentages)
   - Historical claims ("first since...", "best in franchise history", etc.)
   - Search ESPN/official sources to confirm each stat

2. **Every Player-Team Association Must Be Verified**
   - Confirm player is CURRENTLY on the team mentioned
   - Check for 2025 trades (many players changed teams)
   - Never assume - always search to confirm

3. **Every Trend Must Be Verified**
   - "X team is 0-12 since..." - verify exact record
   - "Y player has scored 30+ in Z straight games" - confirm count
   - Historical context claims - verify accuracy

4. **Every Injury Must Be Verified**
   - Injury TYPE matters (ACL vs Achilles vs ankle)
   - Current status (out, questionable, probable)
   - Search for latest updates before publishing

5. **Every Record/Historical Claim Must Be Verified**
   - "Tied the NHL record" vs "Broke the NHL record" - which is it?
   - "First player since..." - who was the previous?
   - Franchise records, league records, personal bests

### Common Errors to Catch:

| Error Type | Example | Fix |
|------------|---------|-----|
| Wrong Season Context | "0-12 since 15-0 start" (15-0 was LAST season) | Clarify which season |
| Outdated Roster | "Durant to Mobley" (Durant is on Rockets now) | Verify current team |
| Wrong Injury Type | "Tatum ACL" (It's actually ACHILLES) | Verify exact injury |
| Wrong Loss Attribution | "Lost to Arizona State" (Actually lost to Gonzaga) | Verify opponent |
| Tied vs Broke Records | "Tied NHL record" (Actually BROKE it) | Verify record status |

### Proofreading Process:

1. **Read the entire content** - Don't skim
2. **Flag every factual claim** - Stats, records, trends, player mentions
3. **Search to verify each claim** - Use WebSearch for current info
4. **Fix errors immediately** - Don't leave for later
5. **Re-read after fixes** - Ensure corrections are accurate

### ⛔ IMPORTANT: Fix Before Pushing ⛔

**NEVER push content with known errors. Fix everything FIRST.**

If you find errors after pushing:
1. Fix immediately
2. Push correction
3. Note the error for future reference

**Credibility is built on accuracy. One false claim destroys trust.**

---

## 2. CONTENT STYLE

### Writing Tone - CRITICAL
- ALWAYS extremely human sounding, analytical, conversational style
- Write like an ENTHUSIASTIC, EMOTIONAL, PASSIONATE human journalist
- NEVER robotic, AI-sounding, or formulaic writing
- Write like a knowledgeable friend who is fired up about their analysis
- Use contractions naturally - "don't" not "do not", "it's" not "it is", "you're" not "you are"
- Be opinionated and take strong stances - show personality and passion
- Use casual transitions - "Look", "Here's the thing", "Let me tell you", "And get this", "Listen"
- Vary sentence structure - mix short punchy sentences with longer analytical ones
- Show emotion and conviction - "This is huge", "I love this spot", "This line is a gift", "This excites me"
- Express enthusiasm and excitement naturally throughout the writing
- NEVER use corporate speak, formal language, or academic tone
- No fluff, no filler - every sentence should add value
- NEVER use bold words in content paragraphs
- NEVER use dashes or bullet points in content (write in flowing paragraphs)
- NEVER reference other websites or external sources

### Content Structure
- Clear sections with gold-colored headers (span style with color gold, font-weight 700, font-size 22px)
- Short paragraphs - 3-5 sentences max per paragraph
- No bold words within content paragraphs
- No plagiarism - Original content only, rewrite everything in your own words
- Write in flowing paragraph format, no lists or bullet points in content

### Writing Style Examples

GOOD - Passionate, human, conversational:
"Look, I get it. Nobody likes laying -195. It feels expensive, and when you run the numbers you see that you need the Dodgers to win 66% of the time just to break even. But here's the reality: sometimes you just have to pay for quality. And that's exactly what we're getting tonight."

BAD - Robotic, AI-sounding, formulaic:
"The Los Angeles Dodgers present a compelling betting opportunity despite the high juice of -195. Analysis indicates that the implied probability may be undervalued. Several factors support this thesis."

GOOD - Emotional and analytical:
"This is the kind of spot that gets me fired up. You've got a dominant pitcher going against a lineup that can't hit breaking balls, and you're getting TWO POINTS as an underdog. Are you kidding me? This is a gift."

BAD - Dry and corporate:
"The statistical analysis suggests a favorable matchup. The underdog status provides additional value. Bettors should consider this opportunity."

---

## 3. FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

### Every Post MUST Include:

#### A. Post Header
```html
<div class="post-header" style="text-align: center;">[TITLE]</div>
```

#### B. Timestamp
```html
<div class="post-time" style="text-align: center;">Posted: [TIME], [DATE]</div>
```
- Format: `12:51 PM, October 27, 2025`
- Get current date/time automatically using: `date '+%-I:%M %p, %B %d, %Y'`
- Always use real-time timestamp unless user specifies otherwise

#### C. Featured Image
```html
<figure style="margin: 20px auto; max-width: 1140px;">
<img alt="[Descriptive alt text]" loading="lazy" src="images/[IMAGE].png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width:85%; border-radius: 8px;"/>
</figure>
```
- Image must be placed AFTER timestamp, BEFORE first paragraph
- Alt text must be descriptive for SEO
- Image file must be in `/images/` folder

#### D. Verdict Section (Blog Posts Only)
```html
<div class="verdict">
<p class="verdict-title">The Pick</p>
<p class="the-pick">[TEAM] [LINE]</p>
</div>
```
- Place at the END of every betting pick post
- Clear, bold display of the final pick

---

## 3. IMAGE REQUIREMENTS

### Image Sourcing
- User will provide image filename (e.g., `1027a.png`, `1027b.png`)
- Images must be copied to `/images/` folder if not already there
- Use relative path: `images/[filename].png`

### Image Placement
- Always AFTER timestamp
- Always BEFORE first paragraph of content
- Wrapped in `<figure>` tag for proper spacing

---

## 4. SEO OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS

### ⛔ FEATURED GAME TITLES: USE "PICKS & PREDICTION" NOT "PREVIEW" ⛔

**PERMANENTLY LOCKED - JANUARY 15, 2026**

**All Featured Game of the Day page titles MUST use "Picks & Prediction" instead of "Preview" or "Showdown" for better long-tail SEO.**

**THE RULE:**
```
CORRECT (SEO-optimized):
<title>Knicks vs Warriors Picks & Prediction - January 15, 2026 | BetLegend</title>
<title>Eagles vs Bills Wild Card Picks & Prediction - January 12, 2026 | BetLegend</title>
<title>Cowboys vs Lions Thursday Night Football Picks & Prediction - December 4, 2025 | BetLegend</title>

WRONG (low search volume):
<title>Knicks vs Warriors Preview - January 15, 2026 | BetLegend</title>
<title>Eagles vs Bills Wild Card Preview - January 12, 2026 | BetLegend</title>
<title>Cowboys vs Lions Showdown - December 4, 2025 | BetLegend</title>
```

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- People search "Team vs Team picks" and "Team vs Team prediction" far more than "preview"
- Long-tail keywords like "Knicks Warriors picks" have less competition
- Better title = higher click-through rate from search results
- "Picks & Prediction" signals actionable betting content

**WHEN CREATING ANY FEATURED GAME PAGE:**
1. Use format: `[Team A] vs [Team B] [Context] Picks & Prediction - [Date] | BetLegend`
2. NEVER use "Preview", "Showdown", or "Analysis" in the title
3. Include the date for freshness signals
4. Keep team names in the title for search matching

---

### CRITICAL: Every Post MUST Include SEO Meta Tags

#### A. Per-Post Meta Tags (Inside blog-post div)
Every single post MUST include these meta tags immediately after the opening `<div class="blog-post">` tag:

```html
<div class="blog-post" id="post-[DATE]-[SLUG]">
<meta name="title" content="[SEO-OPTIMIZED TITLE WITH KEYWORDS]"/>
<meta name="description" content="[145-160 character meta description with keywords and value proposition]"/>
```

**Meta Title Requirements:**
- 50-60 characters optimal length
- Include primary keywords: team names, bet type, sport, date/context
- Format: `[Team] [Line] [Sport] [Context] - [Value Proposition]`
- Example: `"New York Islanders +1.5 at -195 NHL Betting Pick - November 10 Analysis"`
- Include betting terms: "betting pick", "analysis", "prediction", "odds"

**Meta Description Requirements:**
- 145-160 characters optimal length (strict limit for Google display)
- Include: main pick, odds, 2-3 key analysis points
- Call to action or value statement
- Example: `"Expert NHL betting pick for Islanders +1.5 at -195. Detailed analysis on goalie matchup, team form, special teams, defensive structure, and why the puck line offers value today."`

#### B. Primary Keywords to Target

**Every post should naturally incorporate:**
- Sport name (NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, etc.)
- Team names (full names, not just city)
- Bet type (spread, moneyline, over/under, puck line, etc.)
- Odds (exact numbers with minus/plus signs)
- Date context (today, Week 10, November 10, etc.)
- Analysis terms (betting analysis, expert pick, prediction, odds analysis)
- Results terms (betting insights, picks and analysis, sports betting)

**Keyword Density Guidelines:**
- Primary keyword phrase: 2-3% density
- Secondary keywords: 1-2% density each
- Natural placement - NEVER stuff keywords awkwardly
- Use variations and synonyms

#### C. Post ID Slug Format
```html
id="post-[YYYYMMDD]-[team-sport-context-slug]"
```
Examples:
- `id="post-20251110-islanders-puck-line-pick"`
- `id="post-20251109-bucs-patriots-spread-pick"`
- `id="post-20251108-falcons-colts-berlin"`

**Slug Requirements:**
- All lowercase
- Hyphens between words (no underscores)
- Include key identifiers: team, sport/league, or key context
- Keep under 50 characters
- Make it descriptive and SEO-friendly

#### D. Image Alt Text SEO
Every image MUST have descriptive, keyword-rich alt text:

**Format:**
```
[Team Names] [Sport/League] [content type] [bet type/context] [date]
```

**Examples:**
- `"New York Islanders NHL betting pick puck line analysis November 10 2025"`
- `"Tampa Bay Buccaneers New England Patriots NFL Week 10 betting pick analysis spread prediction"`
- `"Los Angeles Dodgers MLB World Series betting analysis moneyline odds"`

**Alt Text Requirements:**
- 120-150 characters optimal
- Include team names, sport, bet type, date
- Natural sentence structure (not comma-separated keywords)
- Descriptive of actual image content

#### E. Header Keyword Optimization

**Post Header (Title):**
- Include primary keyword phrase
- Format varies by post type:
  - Betting picks: `[Team] [Line] - [Context/Hook]`
  - News: `[Event/Player] - [Key Detail]`
- Examples:
  - `"New York Islanders +1.5 at -195"` (concise)
  - `"Tampa Bay Buccaneers -2.5 vs New England Patriots - NFL Week 10 Betting Pick"` (detailed)

**Section Headers (gold headers):**
- Use semantic HTML structure (even though styled with spans)
- Include related keywords naturally
- Examples:
  - "Why Tampa Bay Covers"
  - "The Maye Factor and How Tampa Bay Defends It"
  - "Home Field Advantage and the Spread"

#### F. Content SEO Best Practices

**Keyword Placement Priority:**
1. Post title (highest weight)
2. Meta description
3. First paragraph (critical)
4. Image alt text
5. Section headers
6. Throughout body naturally
7. Final pick line

**First Paragraph Requirements:**
- Include primary keyword phrase in first 100 words
- Include the exact bet and odds
- Set context for SEO (team names, sport, situation)
- Example: "The New York Islanders have quietly put together one of the more defensively structured teams in the Eastern Conference this season, and today's puck line at +1.5 for -195 offers solid value..."

**Internal Linking Opportunities:**
- Link to relevant past picks when appropriate
- Link to records pages
- Link to related analysis
- Use descriptive anchor text with keywords

### Content Length for SEO
- Blog posts (picks): Minimum 1500 words, optimal 2000-2500 words
- News articles: Minimum 500 words, optimal 700-1000 words
- Longer content ranks better - be comprehensive
- Break up long content with section headers

### Semantic Keywords & LSI Terms

Include related terms naturally:
- Betting: "wager", "bet", "value", "edge", "line", "odds", "juice"
- Analysis: "breakdown", "deep dive", "insight", "angle", "matchup"
- Teams: Include conference, division, record when relevant
- Sports: Include league names, season context, week numbers

## 5. POSTING LOCATIONS

### Blog Posts (Picks/Analysis)
- Add to **blog-page10.html** (current picks page)
- Place NEW post at the TOP, above existing posts
- Never delete old posts - they stay on the page
- **When page gets too large**: Create a new page (e.g., blog-page11.html), update pagination, and update ALL site navigation links

### News Articles
- Add to **news-page3.html** (current news page)
- Place NEW article at the TOP, above existing articles
- Wrap in news-post div with gold border styling

### Featured Game of the Day
- Add to **featured-game-of-the-day-page17.html** (current page - December 11, 2025)
- **IMPORTANT**: Every time you add a new Featured Game of the Day post, you MUST:
  1. Create a NEW page (increment the page number)
  2. Update the OLD page's pagination to link to the new page
  3. **⚠️ CRITICAL: Update ALL site navigation links to point to the new page (see 1D below)**
  4. The new page becomes the "newest" page in the pagination

### ⛔ FEATURED GAME OF THE DAY - NO PICKS RULE ⛔

**CRITICAL: Featured Game of the Day pages are ANALYSIS and STATS ONLY. NO PICKS.**

**These pages MUST NOT include:**
- ❌ "BetLegend's Pick" or any pick section
- ❌ "The Verdict" with a specific pick
- ❌ "Take [Team]" language
- ❌ Any explicit betting recommendation
- ❌ "My pick is..." or similar

**These pages MUST include:**
- ✅ Team logos next to team names (use ESPN CDN: https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/[abbrev].png)
- ✅ Deep statistical analysis with verified numbers
- ✅ Injury reports (verified current status)
- ✅ Betting lines (spread, total, moneyline)
- ✅ Key matchup breakdowns
- ✅ ATS trends and betting trends (with specific numbers)
- ✅ "Final Thoughts" section analyzing the matchup (no picks)
- ✅ "Keys To Victory" for both teams

**Purpose:** Featured Game pages are DATA and ANALYSIS resources for bettors to make their own decisions. They are NOT for giving explicit picks.

## 1D. MANDATORY DAILY FEATURED GAME LINK UPDATE

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: EVERY PAGE ON THE SITE MUST LINK TO THE CURRENT FEATURED GAME ⚠️

**EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 8, 2025 - MANDATORY DAILY TASK**

When a new Featured Game of the Day is posted, ALL links across the ENTIRE site must be updated to point to the new page. This includes:
- Every sport page (nba.html, nfl.html, nhl.html, ncaab.html, etc.)
- Every archive page (nba-page2.html, nfl-page3.html, etc.)
- Every navigation dropdown on every page
- Every featured game archive page itself

### WHY THIS MATTERS
- Broken or outdated links destroy user experience
- Users clicking "Featured Game" should ALWAYS see TODAY's featured game
- Old links (e.g., page12 when page15 is current) make the site look unmaintained
- **This happened December 8, 2025: Links pointed to Detroit vs Dallas (Dec 4) instead of Eagles vs Chargers (Dec 8)**

### DAILY UPDATE PROCESS

**Every time a new Featured Game of the Day is created:**

1. **Note the new page number** (e.g., `featured-game-of-the-day-page16.html`)

2. **Run a batch update script** to replace ALL old links:
   ```python
   import os, re
   REPO_PATH = r'C:\Users\Nima\nimadamus.github.io'
   NEW_PAGE = 'featured-game-of-the-day-page16.html'  # Update this number

   for root, dirs, files in os.walk(REPO_PATH):
       dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d != '.git']  # Skip .git
       for f in files:
           if f.endswith('.html'):
               path = os.path.join(root, f)
               with open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as file:
                   content = file.read()
               original = content
               content = re.sub(r'featured-game-of-the-day-page\d+\.html', NEW_PAGE, content)
               content = re.sub(r'featured-game-of-the-day\.html', NEW_PAGE, content)
               if content != original:
                   with open(path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                       file.write(content)
                   print(f'Fixed: {f}')
   ```

3. **Commit and push** the changes immediately

4. **Verify** by clicking the Featured Game link on the live site

### AUTOMATION REMINDER

This update MUST happen EVERY TIME a new Featured Game is posted. Add this to the end-of-day checklist:

- [ ] New Featured Game created
- [ ] ALL site links updated to point to new page
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed
- [ ] Live site verified

### Pagination Update Process (For ALL Paginated Sections)
When creating a new page for any section (blog, featured game, etc.):
1. Create the new page with the next page number
2. Update the previous page's pagination:
   - Change "← Next" from disabled to linking to the new page
   - Update the page number display
3. Run a site-wide update to change ALL navigation links to point to the new page
4. Verify all links work before pushing

### RESULT SECTION HTML FORMAT

**For WINS (green background):**
```html
<div class="result-section" style="background:rgba(0,200,100,0.15);border:1px solid rgba(0,200,100,0.3);border-radius:10px;padding:12px;margin:12px 0;">
<p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:#00ff88;margin-bottom:6px;font-weight:700;">FINAL: [WINNER] [SCORE], [LOSER] [SCORE]</p>
<p style="font-size:0.8rem;color:#ccc;margin:4px 0;">[Spread result] | [O/U result] | [Key stat or note]</p>
</div>
```

**For LOSSES or DID NOT COVER (orange background):**
```html
<div class="result-section" style="background:rgba(255,165,0,0.15);border:1px solid rgba(255,165,0,0.3);border-radius:10px;padding:12px;margin:12px 0;">
<p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:#ffa500;margin-bottom:6px;font-weight:700;">FINAL: [WINNER] [SCORE], [LOSER] [SCORE]</p>
<p style="font-size:0.8rem;color:#ccc;margin:4px 0;">[Spread result] | [O/U result] | [Key stat or note]</p>
</div>
```

---

### PLACEMENT RULES

1. **Place the result section AFTER the game-header div and BEFORE the preview-content div**
2. The result section goes between the header and the written content
3. NEVER place it at the bottom of the game card

**Correct placement:**
```html
<article class="game-preview">
  <div class="game-header">...</div>

  <!-- RESULT SECTION GOES HERE -->
  <div class="result-section" style="...">...</div>

  <div class="preview-content">
    <p>Written content...</p>
  </div>
</article>
```

---

### CONTENT FORMAT RULES

**Line 1 (Score):**
- Format: `FINAL: [WINNING TEAM] [SCORE], [LOSING TEAM] [SCORE]`
- Team names in ALL CAPS
- Winner listed first
- Examples:
  - `FINAL: THUNDER 132, MAVERICKS 111`
  - `FINAL: CELTICS 126, LAKERS 105`
  - `FINAL: GRIZZLIES 107, CLIPPERS 98`

**Line 2 (Analysis):**

## ⛔⛔⛔ UPDATING RECORD SHEETS FROM PICK TRACKER ⛔⛔⛔

### PERMANENTLY LOCKED - DECEMBER 25, 2025

**When user says "update the record sheets from the pick tracker", follow this process:**

### STEP 1: Read the Pick Tracker
- The pick tracker contains all graded picks with results and unit calculations
- Each pick shows: Date, Sport, Pick, Odds, Units, Result (W/L/P), Unit P/L

### STEP 2: Identify Which Record Sheet to Update
Based on the "Sport" column in the tracker:
- **NFL** → `nfl-records.html`
- **NBA** → `nba-records.html`
- **NHL** → `nhl-records.html`
- **NCAAB** → `ncaab-records.html`
- **NCAAF** → `ncaaf-records.html`
- **MLB** → `mlb-records.html`
- **Soccer** → `soccer-records.html`
- **Cross-Sport** or **Parlay** → `crosssport-parlays-records.html`

### STEP 3: Add Each Graded Pick to Its Record Sheet
For each graded pick:
1. Open the appropriate record sheet
2. Add a new row to the picks table with:
   - Date
   - Pick (team, line, odds)
   - Result (W/L/P)
   - Units (+X.XX or -X.XX)
3. Update the running totals at the top of the page

### STEP 4: Update Summary Stats
After adding all picks, recalculate and update:
- Total Record (W-L-P)
- Win Percentage
- Total Units (+/-)
- ROI

### ⛔⛔⛔ UNIT CALCULATION FORMULA - PERMANENTLY LOCKED ⛔⛔⛔

**THIS IS THE CORRECT WAY TO CALCULATE UNIT PROFIT/LOSS. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

#### THE CORE CONCEPT:
The "Units" column = **what you're trying to WIN**, not what you're risking.

- **FAVORITES (negative odds):** You risk MORE to win the units listed
- **UNDERDOGS (positive odds):** You risk the units listed to win MORE

---

#### FORMULA FOR WINS:

**FAVORITE WIN (negative odds like -110, -150, -255):**
```
UNIT_RESULT = +UNITS (you win exactly what you were trying to win)
```
Examples:
- -110 odds, 3 units, WIN → +3.00 units
- -150 odds, 2 units, WIN → +2.00 units
- -255 odds, 3 units, WIN → +3.00 units

**UNDERDOG WIN (positive odds like +120, +145, +200):**
```
UNIT_RESULT = +UNITS × (ODDS / 100)
```
Examples:
- +120 odds, 2 units, WIN → +2.00 × 1.20 = **+2.40 units**
- +145 odds, 1 unit, WIN → +1.00 × 1.45 = **+1.45 units**
- +200 odds, 1.5 units, WIN → +1.50 × 2.00 = **+3.00 units**

---

#### FORMULA FOR LOSSES:

**FAVORITE LOSS (negative odds like -110, -150, -255):**
```
UNIT_RESULT = -UNITS × (|ODDS| / 100)
```
Examples:
- -110 odds, 3 units, LOSS → -3.00 × 1.10 = **-3.30 units**
- -105 odds, 3 units, LOSS → -3.00 × 1.05 = **-3.15 units**
- -150 odds, 2 units, LOSS → -2.00 × 1.50 = **-3.00 units**
- -155 odds, 3 units, LOSS → -3.00 × 1.55 = **-4.65 units**
- -165 odds, 3 units, LOSS → -3.00 × 1.65 = **-4.95 units**

**UNDERDOG LOSS (positive odds like +120, +145, +200):**
```
UNIT_RESULT = -UNITS (you lose exactly what you risked)
```
Examples:
- +120 odds, 2 units, LOSS → **-2.00 units**
- +145 odds, 1 unit, LOSS → **-1.00 units**
- +115 odds, 1.5 units, LOSS → **-1.50 units**

---

#### QUICK REFERENCE TABLE:

| Odds | Units | Result | Calculation | UNIT_RESULT |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| -110 | 3 | WIN | 3 | +3.00 |
| -110 | 3 | LOSS | 3 × 1.10 | -3.30 |
| -105 | 3 | WIN | 3 | +3.00 |
| -105 | 3 | LOSS | 3 × 1.05 | -3.15 |
| -150 | 2 | WIN | 2 | +2.00 |
| -150 | 2 | LOSS | 2 × 1.50 | -3.00 |
| +120 | 2 | WIN | 2 × 1.20 | +2.40 |
| +120 | 2 | LOSS | 2 | -2.00 |
| +145 | 1 | WIN | 1 × 1.45 | +1.45 |
| +145 | 1 | LOSS | 1 | -1.00 |

---

#### WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Favorites: You're RISKING more to WIN the units listed
- Underdogs: You're RISKING the units listed to WIN more
- The units column is always "what you're trying to win"
- Losses on favorites hurt more because you risked more
- Wins on underdogs pay more because you risked less to win more

#### DO NOT:
- ❌ Confuse risk amount with win amount
- ❌ Calculate favorite wins as units × odds (that's for losses)
- ❌ Calculate underdog losses as units × odds (that's for wins)
- ❌ Ever question this formula - it is CORRECT

**IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO CALCULATE UNITS - REFER TO THIS SECTION FIRST.**

### ⛔⛔⛔ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION: HOW RECORD PAGES WORK ⛔⛔⛔

#### PERMANENTLY LOCKED - DECEMBER 29, 2025

**This section documents exactly how the record pages pull data, filter picks, and calculate units. DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THIS IMPLEMENTATION.**

---

#### ARCHITECTURE: DUAL DATA SOURCE SYSTEM

Each record page (nfl-records.html, nba-records.html, etc.) pulls from TWO data sources:

1. **Original Sport-Specific Sheet** - Contains historical picks for that sport only
   - NFL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQgB4WcyyEpMBp_XI_ya6hC7Y8kRaHzrOvuLMq9voGF0nzfqi4lkmAWVb92nDkxUhLVhzr4RTWtZRxq/pub?output=csv`
   - NBA: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQE9RjSNABgl0SxSA1ghp9soUs4gq7teoncN5GLmG5faXmH-sDwXgg0mrk0iQwmSEYExtx6xwFMflXv/pub?output=csv`
   - NHL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRaRwsGOmbXrqAX0xqrDc9XwRCSaAOkuW68TArz3XQp7SMmLirKbdYqU5-zSM_A-MDNKG6sbdwZac6I/pub?output=csv`
   - NCAAF: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ9c45xiuXWNe-fAXYMoNb00kCBHfMf4Yn-Xr2LUqdCIiuoiXXDgrDa5mq1PZqxjg8hx-5KnS0L4uVU/pub?output=csv`
   - NCAAB: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQrFb66HE90gCwliIBQlZ5cNBApJWtGuUV1WbS4pd12SMrs_3qlmSFZCLJ9vBmfgZKcaaGyg4G15J3Y/pub?output=csv`

2. **Master Pick Tracker** - Contains ALL recent picks across ALL sports
   - URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1izhxwiiazn99SRqcK8QpUE4pfvDRIFpgSyw5ZlMsvmY/export?format=csv&gid=0`
   - Columns: Date, Sport, Pick, Odds, Units, Result, Profit/Loss

**WHY TWO SOURCES:**
- Original sheets have historical data that may not be in the tracker
- Pick tracker has recent picks that may not be in the sport-specific sheets yet
- Combining both ensures ALL picks appear on the record pages

---

#### DATA LOADING PROCESS (JavaScript)

```javascript
async function loadDataFromSheets() {
    // STEP 1: Fetch from original sport-specific sheet
    const originalResponse = await fetch(GOOGLE_SHEETS_CSV_URL + '&cache=' + Date.now());
    const originalCsv = await originalResponse.text();
    const originalData = parseCSV(originalCsv);

    // STEP 2: Fetch from master pick tracker
    let trackerData = [];
    try {
        const trackerResponse = await fetch(PICK_TRACKER_URL + '&cache=' + Date.now());
        const trackerCsv = await trackerResponse.text();
        const allTrackerData = parseCSV(trackerCsv);

        // STEP 3: Filter tracker data for THIS sport only
        trackerData = allTrackerData.filter(row => isSportPick(row)).map(row => {
            // Calculate units using correct formula (see below)
            const rawUnits = row.Units || '3';
            const odds = row.Line || row.Odds || '';  // IMPORTANT: parseCSV renames Odds to Line
            const result = row.Result || '';
            const calculatedUnits = calculateUnitResult(rawUnits, odds, result);
            return {
                Date: row.Date || '',
                Pick: row.Pick || row.Picks || '',
                Odds: odds,
                Result: result,
                Units: calculatedUnits.toString()
            };
        });
    } catch (e) {
        console.log('Pick tracker fetch failed, using original data only');
    }

    // STEP 4: Combine both datasets
    const combinedData = [...originalData, ...trackerData];

    // STEP 5: Deduplicate by Date + Pick
    const seen = new Set();
    const uniqueData = combinedData.filter(row => {
        const key = `${row.Date}|${row.Pick}`;
        if (seen.has(key)) return false;
        seen.add(key);
        return true;
    });

    // Process and display the data...
}
```

---

#### CRITICAL BUG FIX: ODDS vs LINE COLUMN

**THE PROBLEM:**
The `parseCSV()` function in each record page renames the "Odds" column header to "Line":
```javascript
headers = headers.map((h, idx) => {
    if (h.toLowerCase() === 'odds') return 'Line';  // THIS RENAMES IT
    // ...
});
```

**THE SOLUTION:**
When accessing odds from tracker data, ALWAYS check BOTH column names:
```javascript
const odds = row.Line || row.Odds || '';  // Check Line first, then Odds
```

**IF YOU FORGET THIS:** The odds will be undefined, the unit calculation will fail, and picks won't show up correctly on the record pages.

---

#### SPORT FILTERING LOGIC

The pick tracker has a "Sport" column with values like "Football", "Basketball", "Hockey". But "Football" could be NFL OR NCAAF. Here's how each record page filters:

**NFL (nfl-records.html):**
```javascript
function isNFLPick(row) {
    const sport = (row.Sport || '').toLowerCase();
    const pick = (row.Pick || row.Picks || '').toLowerCase();
    if (sport !== 'football') return false;

    // Must contain an NFL team name
    const nflTeamNames = ['49ers', 'niners', 'bears', 'bengals', 'bills', 'broncos',
        'browns', 'buccaneers', 'bucs', 'cardinals', 'chargers', 'chiefs', 'colts',
        'commanders', 'cowboys', 'dolphins', 'eagles', 'falcons', 'giants', 'jaguars',
        'jags', 'jets', 'lions', 'packers', 'panthers', 'patriots', 'pats', 'raiders',
        'rams', 'ravens', 'saints', 'seahawks', 'steelers', 'texans', 'titans', 'vikings'];
    return nflTeamNames.some(team => pick.includes(team));
}
```

**NCAAF (ncaaf-records.html):**
```javascript
function isNCAAFPick(row) {
    const sport = (row.Sport || '').toLowerCase();
    const pick = (row.Pick || row.Picks || '').toLowerCase();
    if (sport !== 'football') return false;

    // Must NOT contain an NFL team name (inverse of NFL filter)
    const nflTeams = ['49ers', 'niners', 'bears', 'bengals', ...];
    return !nflTeams.some(team => pick.includes(team));
}
```

**NBA (nba-records.html):**
```javascript
function isNBAPick(row) {
    const sport = (row.Sport || '').toLowerCase();
    const pick = (row.Pick || row.Picks || '').toLowerCase();
    if (sport !== 'basketball') return false;

    // Exclude NFL team names (for cross-sport parlays)
    const nflTeams = ['49ers', 'bears', 'bengals', ...];
    return !nflTeams.some(team => pick.includes(team));
}
```

**NCAAB (ncaab-records.html):**
```javascript
function isNCAABPick(row) {
    const sport = (row.Sport || '').toLowerCase();
    const pick = (row.Pick || row.Picks || '').toLowerCase();
    if (sport !== 'basketball') return false;

    // Exclude NBA team names
    const nbaTeams = ['lakers', 'celtics', 'warriors', 'nets', 'knicks', 'heat',
        'bulls', 'mavericks', 'mavs', 'spurs', 'rockets', 'suns', 'bucks', 'sixers',
        '76ers', 'raptors', 'thunder', 'okc', 'jazz', 'nuggets', 'blazers', 'wolves',
        'pelicans', 'grizzlies', 'kings', 'clippers', 'hawks', 'hornets', 'magic',
        'pistons', 'pacers', 'cavaliers', 'cavs', 'wizards'];
    return !nbaTeams.some(team => pick.includes(team));
}
```

**NHL (nhl-records.html):**
```javascript
function isNHLPick(row) {
    const sport = (row.Sport || '').toLowerCase();
    return sport === 'hockey';  // Simple - hockey is always NHL
}
```

---

#### UNIT CALCULATION FUNCTION (JavaScript Implementation)

**This is the EXACT function used in all record pages:**

```javascript
// CORRECT UNIT CALCULATION FORMULA (from CLAUDE.md - December 24, 2025)
// Units column = what you're trying to WIN, not what you're risking
// FAVORITE WIN (negative odds): UNIT_RESULT = +UNITS (win what you tried to win)
// UNDERDOG WIN (positive odds): UNIT_RESULT = +UNITS × (ODDS / 100) (win more)
// FAVORITE LOSS (negative odds): UNIT_RESULT = -UNITS × (|ODDS| / 100) (lose more)
// UNDERDOG LOSS (positive odds): UNIT_RESULT = -UNITS (lose what you risked)

function calculateUnitResult(unitsStake, odds, result) {
    const stake = parseFloat(unitsStake);
    const oddsNum = parseFloat(odds);
    const resultUpper = (result || '').toUpperCase().trim();

    if (isNaN(stake) || isNaN(oddsNum)) return 0;

    if (resultUpper.startsWith('W')) {
        // WIN
        if (oddsNum < 0) {
            // Favorite win: you win exactly the units (what you were trying to win)
            return stake;
        } else {
            // Underdog win: you win units × (odds/100)
            return stake * (oddsNum / 100);
        }
    } else if (resultUpper.startsWith('L')) {
        // LOSS
        if (oddsNum < 0) {
            // Favorite loss: you lose units × (|odds|/100) because you risked more
            return -stake * (Math.abs(oddsNum) / 100);
        } else {
            // Underdog loss: you lose exactly the units (what you risked)
            return -stake;
        }
    } else {
        // Push or other
        return 0;
    }
}
```

---

#### WORKED EXAMPLES WITH THIS FUNCTION

**Example 1: Chiefs +14 at -130, 3 units, WIN**
```
stake = 3
oddsNum = -130 (negative = favorite juice)
result = 'W'

Since oddsNum < 0 AND result is WIN:
  return stake = 3.00

RESULT: +3.00 units
```

**Example 2: Eagles +3 at -110, 3 units, WIN**
```
stake = 3
oddsNum = -110 (negative = favorite juice)
result = 'W'

Since oddsNum < 0 AND result is WIN:
  return stake = 3.00

RESULT: +3.00 units
```

**Example 3: Sharks ML at +120, 1 unit, WIN**
```
stake = 1
oddsNum = 120 (positive = underdog)
result = 'W'

Since oddsNum > 0 AND result is WIN:
  return stake * (oddsNum / 100) = 1 * 1.20 = 1.20

RESULT: +1.20 units
```

**Example 4: Chargers -1 at -110, 2 units, LOSS**
```
stake = 2
oddsNum = -110 (negative = favorite juice)
result = 'L'

Since oddsNum < 0 AND result is LOSS:
  return -stake * (|oddsNum| / 100) = -2 * 1.10 = -2.20

RESULT: -2.20 units
```

**Example 5: Maple Leafs ML at +105, 3 units, LOSS**
```
stake = 3
oddsNum = 105 (positive = underdog)
result = 'L'

Since oddsNum > 0 AND result is LOSS:
  return -stake = -3.00

RESULT: -3.00 units
```

---

#### DEDUPLICATION LOGIC

When combining data from both sources, duplicates are removed:

```javascript
const seen = new Set();
const uniqueData = combinedData.filter(row => {
    const key = `${row.Date}|${row.Pick}`;  // Create unique key from date + pick text
    if (seen.has(key)) return false;         // Skip if already seen
    seen.add(key);                           // Mark as seen
    return true;                             // Keep this row
});
```

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Same pick might exist in both the original sheet AND the tracker
- Without deduplication, it would appear twice and double-count units
- The key is Date + Pick text combined

---

#### TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST

If picks aren't showing up on a record page:

1. **Check the Sport column** - Is it "Football", "Basketball", or "Hockey"?
2. **Check the team names** - Does the pick text contain recognizable team names?
3. **Check the Odds/Line bug** - Are you using `row.Line || row.Odds`?
4. **Check the Result column** - Must start with W, L, or P
5. **Check the Units column** - Must be a valid number
6. **Check the Odds column** - Must be a valid number (can be negative or positive)
7. **Clear browser cache** - Google Sheets data may be cached
