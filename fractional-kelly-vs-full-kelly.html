 <h1>Fractional Kelly vs Full Kelly</h1>
 <p class="meta">Why professional bettors almost never use full Kelly</p>

 <p>The Kelly Criterion tells you the mathematically optimal bet size for maximum long-term growth. So why would anyone bet less than the optimal amount?</p>

 <p>The answer comes down to one word: volatility. Full Kelly is aggressive. Very aggressive. And in the real world, where your edge estimates are never perfectly accurate, full Kelly can lead to stomach-churning swings that most bettors cannot handle, both financially and emotionally.</p>

 <h2>The Problem With Full Kelly</h2>

 <p>Full Kelly maximizes your expected growth rate, but it also maximizes your volatility. Here is what that looks like in practice:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>Large drawdowns are common, even when you have a real edge</li>
 <li>A bad week can wipe out months of gains</li>
 <li>The swings can shake your confidence in the strategy itself</li>
 <li>If your edge estimate is even slightly wrong, you are overbetting</li>
 </ul>

 <p>That last point is crucial. Full Kelly assumes you know your true win probability with perfect accuracy. But nobody does. If you think you have a 55% edge but your actual edge is 52%, you are betting nearly twice as much as you should. This overexposure compounds over time and can lead to significant losses.</p>

 <p>Bill Benter, who made many millions using a fractional Kelly approach to racetrack wagering, has noted that even the best computer handicapping models can overestimate the edge by a factor of two. Someone attempting to place a Kelly bet might unintentionally be placing a twice-Kelly bet, which dramatically cuts the compound return rate.</p>

 <h2>What Is Fractional Kelly?</h2>

 <p>Fractional Kelly means betting a fraction of what the full Kelly formula recommends. The most common fractions are:</p>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Half Kelly (50%):</strong> Bet half of the recommended amount. This is the most popular choice among professionals.</li>
 <li><strong>Quarter Kelly (25%):</strong> Very conservative. Ideal for uncertain edges or new bettors still validating their approach.</li>
 <li><strong>Three-quarter Kelly (75%):</strong> Occasionally used by bettors with highly validated models and large sample sizes.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Half Kelly is particularly appealing because it cuts volatility drastically while decreasing the return by only about 25%. You capture 75% of the optimal growth rate with far less risk.</p>

 <h2>Comparing the Strategies</h2>

 <p>Here is how different Kelly fractions compare for a bettor with a 54% win rate on -110 odds:</p>

 <table>
 <thead>
 <tr>
 <th>Strategy</th>
 <th>Bet Size</th>
 <th>Growth Rate</th>
 <th>Volatility</th>
 <th>Max Drawdown Risk</th>
 </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
 <tr>
 <td>Full Kelly</td>
 <td>~5.5%</td>
 <td>100%</td>
 <td>High</td>
 <td>Moderate to High</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Half Kelly</td>
 <td>~2.75%</td>
 <td>75%</td>
 <td>Low</td>
 <td>Low</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Quarter Kelly</td>
 <td>~1.4%</td>
 <td>~50%</td>
 <td>Very Low</td>
 <td>Very Low</td>
 </tr>
 </tbody>
 </table>

 <p>The key insight: half Kelly gives you 75% of the growth rate with dramatically less volatility. You sacrifice only 25% of your potential growth in exchange for a much smoother ride.</p>

 <h2>Why Half Kelly Is the Sweet Spot</h2>

 <p>Half Kelly has become the industry standard for several reasons:</p>

 <h3>It protects against estimation errors</h3>
 <p>Even the best handicappers overestimate their edge. Half Kelly provides a buffer. If your true edge is smaller than you think, you are not overexposed. Edward Thorp has explained that it is not primarily uncertainty, but a background tendency to overestimate winning chances, which justifies a partial Kelly strategy.</p>

 <h3>It smooths out the variance</h3>
 <p>With half Kelly, losing streaks hurt less and winning streaks still compound nicely. You can stick with the strategy through inevitable rough patches.</p>

 <h3>It is psychologically sustainable</h3>
 <p>Full Kelly can recommend betting 10% or more of your bankroll on a single game. Most bettors cannot handle that emotionally. Half Kelly keeps bet sizes in a range that feels manageable.</p>

 <h3>The math still works in your favor</h3>
 <p>Capturing 75% of optimal growth is still excellent. Over hundreds of bets, this compounds into significant returns while letting you sleep at night.</p>

 <h2>The Drawdown Difference</h2>

 <p>One of the most striking differences between full and fractional Kelly is the probability of large drawdowns. A full Kelly bettor has roughly a 1 in 3 chance of halving their bankroll before doubling it. A half Kelly bettor has only about a 1 in 9 chance of the same.</p>

 <table>
 <thead>
 <tr>
 <th>Strategy</th>
 <th>Chance of 50% Drawdown Before Doubling</th>
 </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
 <tr>
 <td>Full Kelly</td>
 <td>~33% (1 in 3)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Half Kelly</td>
 <td>~11% (1 in 9)</td>
 </tr>
 </tbody>
 </table>

 <p>A 50% drawdown with full Kelly means you need to double your bankroll just to get back to even. With half Kelly, you are far less likely to face that situation in the first place.</p>

 <div class="warn-box">
 <p><strong>When to avoid full Kelly entirely:</strong> If you cannot verify your edge with hundreds of tracked bets, or if you are betting correlated events on the same day, or if your bankroll is money you cannot afford to lose, stick to quarter Kelly or even lower.</p>
 </div>

 <h2>When to Use Quarter Kelly</h2>

 <p>Quarter Kelly is appropriate when:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>You are new to Kelly betting and still validating your edge</li>
 <li>Your sample size is small (fewer than 200 tracked bets)</li>
 <li>You are betting a new sport or market where your edge is uncertain</li>
 <li>You are risk-averse and prioritize capital preservation</li>
 <li>You are betting with a bankroll you cannot afford to see decline significantly</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>See It For Yourself</h2>

 <div class="highlight-box">
 <p>The best way to understand the difference is to see it visually. You can run a <a href="kelly-simulation.html">bankroll simulation</a> that compares full Kelly, half Kelly, quarter Kelly, and flat betting over hundreds of bets. Watch how the volatility differs and how often full Kelly experiences deep drawdowns.</p>
 </div>

 <h2>Which Fraction Should You Use?</h2>

 <p>Here is a simple guide:</p>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>New to Kelly or fewer than 100 tracked bets:</strong> Quarter Kelly</li>
 <li><strong>100-500 tracked bets with proven edge:</strong> Half Kelly</li>
 <li><strong>500+ bets with statistically validated edge:</strong> Half to three-quarter Kelly</li>
 <li><strong>Professional syndicate with sophisticated models:</strong> Up to 75% Kelly, but rarely full</li>
 </ul>

 <p>When in doubt, go lower. You can always increase your fraction as you build confidence in your edge estimates. Starting too aggressive is a much bigger mistake than starting too conservative.</p>

 <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

 <p>Full Kelly is mathematically optimal in a world of perfect information. We do not live in that world. Fractional Kelly, especially half Kelly, is the practical choice for real bettors with imperfect edge estimates and finite emotional tolerance for volatility.</p>

 <p>The professionals know this. They have seen what full Kelly does during a bad streak. They have watched accounts swing wildly on paper. Almost universally, they have settled on fractional Kelly as the sustainable path to long-term growth.</p>

 <p>You can <a href="kelly-criterion.html">calculate your optimal bet size</a> using any fraction you choose. Start conservative, track your results, and adjust as you validate your edge over time.</p>
