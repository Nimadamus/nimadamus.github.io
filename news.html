  <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">The NHL Draft kicked off with a bang as standout winger Matthew Schaefer was taken first overall by the Columbus Blue Jackets. The 18-year-old Canadian forward has been dominating junior leagues with his combination of speed, skill, and hockey IQ. Schaefer not only led the OHL in goals but also showed strong two-way potential, impressing scouts with his defensive awareness and forechecking ability.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">This marks the second time in three years that the Blue Jackets have picked in the top three, and Schaefer instantly gives them a cornerstone to build around. Columbus fans have reason to be optimistic. Schaefer said in a post-draft interview that he's ready to get to work and make an impact as soon as possible. “I’ve dreamed about this moment since I was a kid. Now it’s time to earn it.”</p>

    <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">Cam Davis has quietly become one of the more intriguing longshots on the PGA Tour this week. At 90 to 1 odds, he’s being completely overlooked by the public, but there are a few reasons to believe he’s got a real shot at making noise in Detroit.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">First, Davis has some serious course history working in his favor. He won the Rocket Mortgage Classic back in 2021 and has made the cut here in every appearance since. That kind of comfort on a track like Detroit Golf Club, which heavily rewards strong tee-to-green play, should not be underestimated.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">Second, he’s trending in the right direction. Over his last five starts, Davis has posted a pair of top-20 finishes including a T12 at the PGA Championship. His iron play has been much sharper, and he gained over four strokes tee to green in his last outing. That’s a great sign coming into a birdie-heavy tournament.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">He also ranks top 25 in par-5 scoring over the last 50 rounds, a key stat when it comes to contending at Rocket Mortgage. With soft conditions and a favorable weather setup this week, the tournament could turn into a putting contest—and Davis is more than capable when his flatstick heats up.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">While big names like Finau and Morikawa sit atop the odds board, this might be the perfect event for a proven past champion like Davis to sneak into contention again. At 90 to 1, it’s a value play that deserves a second look.</p>
