    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      At <strong>BetLegend</strong>, every pick you see on our site is generated by a proprietary statistical model.
      We don’t just guess — we run math. Our model analyzes dozens of data points, including advanced metrics,
      matchup history, home/road splits, team form, and situational factors. But...
    </p>

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      We don’t like to divulge too much about the model itself. Why? Because the edge comes from knowing things the
      market doesn’t. If we give it all away, the model loses power. That said, we believe in transparency.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      That’s why you’ll find short write-ups on our blog or pick pages — those explanations give you a taste of
      what the model saw. Think of them like a window into the engine room. We’ll reference key inputs that helped
      justify the pick (bullpen strength, SP performance, hitting splits, etc.) — without giving away the full
      formula.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
      If you ever have questions about a pick or want to understand more about our process, feel free to reach out.
      We’re building something real here — and we’re glad you’re part of it.
