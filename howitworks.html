    <h1>How Our Picks Are Made</h1>
    <p>
      Every pick you see on BetLegend is backed by data. Our model combines years of statistical trends,
      matchup analysis, home/road splits, advanced pitcher metrics, and live market movement to identify
      value opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said — we don’t give away the full formula. Why? Because the edge comes from doing what others don’t.
      If we publish every input or logic string, the advantage disappears. But we still want transparency.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when we post a pick, we’ll usually include a short write-up explaining some of what went into it:
      recent form, splits, bullpen depth, or even just matchup history. These write-ups are meant to help you
      understand the logic — not decode the entire engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re not selling magic. This is math. This is process. And we’re doing it because we believe it works.
      If you want to follow along, track results, or just see what we’re about, we’re glad you’re here.
