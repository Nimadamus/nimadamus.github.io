<div class="post-header">• Reds vs. Guardians Under 8.5 (+100) – June 9, 2025</div>
<div class="post-time">Posted: 5:56 PM – June 8, 2025</div>
<p>Monday’s matchup between the Reds and Guardians offers sneaky value on the total. With the line sitting at 8.5 and even money on the under, this projects as a lower scoring affair, especially when you dig into the starters and the current state of both offenses.</p>
<p>The Reds send veteran lefty Wade Miley to the mound. He’s been sidelined for most of the season but returns to the rotation following Hunter Greene’s injury. While Miley’s ERA sits at an inflated 18.00 from two early season starts, it’s worth noting that he was recovering from a shoulder issue and pitched much better in recent minor league rehab outings. Across 2023, Miley posted a 3.14 ERA over 120 innings, so he’s capable of limiting damage when healthy.</p>
<p>The Guardians will counter with right hander Luis Ortiz, who’s been solid if unspectacular this season. Through 11 starts, Ortiz has compiled a 4.02 ERA with a 1.36 WHIP and has been efficient lately, giving up two earned runs or fewer in four of his last five starts. In his last outing, he threw six scoreless innings against the White Sox, keeping the ball on the ground and limiting hard contact.</p>
<p>Offensively, neither team has shown much life at the plate recently. Over the last 14 days, the Reds are hitting just .219 with a .645 OPS, ranking them 25th in MLB. They’ve struggled mightily against right handed pitching and have failed to score more than four runs in six of their last eight games. The Guardians haven’t been much better, with a team OPS of .658 during that same stretch. They’re averaging 3.6 runs per game across their last 10 contests and are showing signs of fatigue heading into this interleague matchup.</p>
<p>Bullpen trends point to added confidence in the under. Cleveland’s relievers have been one of the most consistent groups in baseball with a 3.18 ERA on the year, while Cincinnati’s pen has stabilized lately with a 3.59 ERA over the past 30 days. Both managers have leaned more on their bullpens early in games, especially when starters hit pitch count limits.</p>
<p>Weather should also be on our side. The forecast in Cleveland calls for temperatures in the mid 60s with light wind blowing in from right field. Historically, Progressive Field plays larger under these conditions, reducing home run potential and favoring pitchers who keep the ball on the ground, like Miley and Ortiz.</p>
<p>All signs suggest a slower paced game with limited offensive outbursts. Between two soft hitting lineups, steady bullpen arms, and favorable pitching conditions, this total feels a run too high.</p>
<p>Final pick: Reds vs Guardians under 8.5 at +100</p>

    • Twins vs Blue Jays Preview: Minnesota Twins -170 – June 8th, 2025
  </div>
<div class="post-time" style="color:#aaa; font-size:15px; margin-bottom:24px;">
    Posted: 10:40 p.m. – June 7th, 2025
  </div>
<div style="font-size:16px; color:white; line-height:1.7;">
    The Minnesota Twins are currently listed at -170 for Sunday’s matchup against the Toronto Blue Jays, and this line reflects more than just home field advantage. With Joe Ryan taking the mound and the Jays trotting out Bowden Francis, Minnesota is in a favorable position across nearly every meaningful category.
    <br/><br/>
<strong>Joe Ryan</strong> has quietly put together a very strong season. He enters this start with a 6-2 record, a 2.91 ERA, and an elite 0.91 WHIP across 68 innings pitched. He's racked up 76 strikeouts to just 12 walks—a phenomenal 6.3 K/BB ratio. Perhaps more importantly, Ryan has been extremely effective in limiting power: opponents are slugging just .331 against him. Over his last four starts, he hasn’t allowed more than 2 earned runs in any outing, and he’s gone at least six innings in each. His consistency gives the Twins a dependable edge, especially at home.
    <br/><br/>
<strong>Bowden Francis</strong>, meanwhile, has struggled mightily this season. The right-hander owns a 5.84 ERA and has allowed 17 home runs in just 57 innings—that’s one long ball every 3.3 innings, among the worst marks in the majors. He also has an ugly 1.47 WHIP and opponents are hitting .288 off him. Francis doesn’t have the stuff to miss bats consistently, and against a patient, power-heavy Minnesota lineup, this sets up as a difficult assignment.
    <br/><br/>
    Minnesota has also been hitting much better over the past few weeks. Since May 20, the Twins have ranked 6th in MLB in team OPS (.770), 4th in isolated power (.198), and they’ve launched 28 home runs over their last 17 games. Royce Lewis has made an immediate impact since returning, while Carlos Correa has turned a corner, posting a .348 OBP over the past 15 days. Byron Buxton has also shown signs of life, and rookie Brooks Lee is flashing plate discipline beyond his years.
    <br/><br/>
    In terms of bullpen edge, the Twins are more stable as well. Jhoan Durán is back closing games, averaging 101.3 mph on his fastball, and the bridge relievers (Thielbar, Staumont, Jackson) have combined for a 3.11 ERA since mid-May. The Blue Jays, on the other hand, rank 23rd in bullpen ERA and have blown 5 saves in the last 14 opportunities.
    <br/><br/>
    This is also a strong scheduling spot for Minnesota. They’re 8-2 in Sunday games and 11-3 in the final game of a series. The Jays, meanwhile, have a losing record in rubber matches and are just 13-16 on the road overall this season.
    <br/><br/>
    If you’re looking for a high-probability favorite with both a strong starting pitcher and a clear bullpen advantage, this is your spot.
    <br/><br/>
<strong>Our pick: Minnesota Twins -170</strong>

    • Phillies vs Pirates Under 7 – June 8, 2025
  </div>
<div class="post-time" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
    Posted: 7:04 PM – June 7, 2025
  </div>
<div style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
<p>Sunday’s game between the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates sets up as one of the best under spots on the board, with the total opening at 7 and two high end arms toeing the rubber. Paul Skenes continues to emerge as a frontline ace, while Cristopher Sánchez quietly ranks among the most efficient contact managers in the National League.</p>
<p>Skenes enters the start with a 2.43 ERA and 60 strikeouts across 44.1 innings. His 12.2 K/9 ranks top 10 among all starters with at least 40 innings pitched. Even more impressively, opponents are hitting just .188 off him the first time through the order, and he’s allowed just two home runs all season. His fastball averages 98.8 mph and pairs with a vicious slider that generates a 41% whiff rate. In five road starts, he’s posted a 1.89 ERA and a 0.91 WHIP . elite numbers that travel.</p>
<p>Cristopher Sánchez may not have the name recognition, but he’s been just as reliable. He holds a 2.75 ERA over 11 starts, with a 1.14 WHIP and only 3 home runs allowed in 59 innings. Sánchez is especially tough at Citizens Bank Park, where his home ERA is 1.62 this season. He owns a 58% ground ball rate and gives up hard contact just 27.4% of the time . top 15 among qualifying pitchers. Against right handed hitters, he’s limited opponents to a .213 batting average and just a .604 OPS.</p>
<p>Offensively, both teams are in less than ideal spots. The Pirates rank 28th in OPS vs left handed pitching and have scored 2 runs or fewer in 7 of their last 10 games. Their strikeout rate jumps to 25.8% against southpaws, and they struggle to string hits together. Meanwhile, the Phillies have been oddly slow starting at home, averaging just 2.1 runs in the first five innings across their last 10 games. They're also unfamiliar with Skenes, which gives him a major edge the first time through the lineup.</p>
<p>Weather is another bonus for the under. Sunday’s forecast in Philadelphia calls for overcast skies, temperatures in the low 60s, and slight wind blowing in. Humidity will be low, limiting ball carry. This is about as pitcher friendly as Citizens Bank Park gets in June.</p>
<p>Both bullpens are decent but shaky at times, which is why this game may see sharper action on both the **first five under** and the full game under 7. But with two starters who limit power, throw strikes, and generate weak contact, there’s a strong case to be made that we see a 2 1 or 3 2 type game here . one that never threatens to break the number.</p>
<p>Official Pick: Phillies vs Pirates Under 7 (Full Game)</p>

    • Skenes vs Sánchez: First 5 Under on Watch in Phillies–Pirates Pitching Duel – June 8, 2025
  </div>
<div class="post-time" style="color: #aaa; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
    Posted: 6:58 PM – June 7, 2025
  </div>
<div style="font-size: 16px; color: white; line-height: 1.7;">
<p>Sunday’s matchup between the Phillies and Pirates brings one of the most electric rookie arms in baseball, Paul Skenes, up against one of the league’s most quietly effective lefties in Cristopher Sánchez. While sportsbooks haven’t released totals yet, it’s I expected we’ll see a line around 6.5 or 7 . and sharp bettors are already circling the first five innings under as a spot to watch.</p>
<p>Paul Skenes has been as good as advertised since being called up. With a fastball averaging over 98 mph, a devastating slider, and elite control, he’s sporting a 2.48 ERA with a 12.3 K/9 and a strikeout to walk ratio near 6 to 1. He’s also been near untouchable early in games. Through his first two times through the order, opponents are hitting just .183 with a whiff rate in the top 10% of all starters. He’s a mismatch for a Phillies offense that hasn’t seen him before and has struggled in the opening frames of games.</p>
<p>Cristopher Sánchez, meanwhile, has become a model of consistency in Philadelphia’s rotation. His changeup is one of the most effective in baseball, generating groundballs at a 56% clip. Over his last 7 starts, he’s posted a 1.72 ERA at home with just 1 home run allowed. He’s been especially sharp against teams like Pittsburgh who lack right handed power and tend to chase.</p>
<p>The Pirates come into this game ranked 27th in MLB in OPS vs left handed pitching, and they've failed to score more than two runs through five innings in 9 of their last 12. The Phillies, while a stronger offense overall, have gone ice cold early in games . they’ve scored 1 run or fewer in the first five innings in 9 of their last 13.</p>
<p>Add to that some favorable weather conditions . overcast skies, mid 60s temps, low humidity . and this projects as a very pitcher friendly setup. The ball won’t carry well, and both starters are strike throwers with the ability to get out of trouble on their own.</p>
<p>While full game unders are always risky with volatile bullpens (especially Pittsburgh’s), this looks like a clean path to a slow, methodical start. As of now, no official numbers are posted, but if a first five under opens at 3 or 2.5, it could still hold value depending on juice and early pace I expectations.</p>
<p>Lean: First 5 Innings Under (Projected Line: 3.0 or 2.5)</p>
