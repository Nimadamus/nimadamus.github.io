<h2 style="text-align:center; color:#d4af37;">Rivalry Week Black Friday: Historic Matchups and CFP Implications</h2>
<div class="post-time">Posted: November 28, 2025 | Ole Miss @ Mississippi State, Iowa @ Nebraska, Georgia vs Georgia Tech, Indiana @ Purdue, Texas A&M @ Texas, Arizona @ Arizona State</div>

<p>Black Friday delivers the premier day of college football Rivalry Week with eight games carrying massive implications for the College Football Playoff. The marquee primetime matchups feature undefeated Indiana putting their perfect season on the line at Purdue and Texas A&M seeking their first loss as they visit Texas in the renewed Lone Star Showdown. Earlier, Georgia faces Georgia Tech and Ole Miss battles Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; color:gold; font-size:22px; margin:30px 0 18px 0;">OLE MISS @ MISSISSIPPI STATE (EGG BOWL) | 12:00 PM ET | ABC</h3>
<div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0; color:#aaa;">Davis Wade Stadium, Starkville | Ole Miss -7 | O/U 62.5</div>

<p>The 122nd Egg Bowl brings No. 7 Ole Miss (10-1, 6-1 SEC) to Starkville to face Mississippi State (5-6, 1-6 SEC) in a game with vastly different implications for each team. The Rebels are likely bound for the College Football Playoff with a win and have won four straight. Lane Kiffin has this program playing elite football, though his future is the subject of endless speculation as other programs pursue him.</p>

<p>Mississippi State needs this win for bowl eligibility after a disappointing conference run. The Bulldogs haven't won six games since 2022 but have extra motivation facing their bitter rival. Historically, State covers in the Egg Bowl - they're 5-1-1 ATS in their last seven meetings and 9-3 ATS in their last 12 games overall. The total has gone under in eight straight Egg Bowls, so despite the 62.5 number, this could be lower-scoring than expected.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; color:gold; font-size:22px; margin:30px 0 18px 0;">#4 GEORGIA vs #23 GEORGIA TECH | 3:30 PM ET | ABC</h3>
<div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0; color:#aaa;">Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta | UGA -13.5 | O/U 59.5</div>

<p>Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate returns to Mercedes-Benz Stadium with No. 4 Georgia (10-1) facing No. 23 Georgia Tech (9-2). Last year's meeting went to eight overtimes with Georgia escaping 44-42, and the Yellow Jackets have covered three of the last four meetings. Tech is coming off a loss to Pittsburgh but has been competitive all season. Kirby Smart's Bulldogs are heavy favorites but haven't been dominant against the spread when laying big numbers.</p>

<p>Georgia Tech has something to prove after their upset loss, and Brent Key has built a program that won't back down from the Bulldogs. The implied score of Georgia 37, Georgia Tech 23 suggests a comfortable Bulldog victory, but rivalry games rarely follow scripts. Georgia's 1-3 ATS record when favored by 13.5+ this season is concerning. The over has hit in four of the last six meetings between these teams.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; color:gold; font-size:22px; margin:30px 0 18px 0;">#2 INDIANA @ PURDUE | 7:30 PM ET | NBC</h3>
<div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0; color:#aaa;">Ross-Ade Stadium, West Lafayette | IND -28.5 | O/U 53.5</div>

<p>Can Indiana complete the unthinkable? The No. 2 Hoosiers (11-0) are one win away from their first undefeated regular season since 1945 against a Purdue team that has lost nine straight and 17 consecutive Big Ten games. The 28.5-point spread is massive, but Indiana has been covering everything in sight. Curt Cignetti has transformed this program into a national power in just one year.</p>

<p>These teams last met with Indiana winning 66-0, so the spread isn't crazy given recent history. Indiana's 6-5 ATS record shows they haven't always covered huge numbers, but this spot feels different. The Hoosiers have motivation to make a statement before the CFP selection, and Purdue has nothing to play for. Indiana rolls in a coronation game that sets up their playoff push.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; color:gold; font-size:22px; margin:30px 0 18px 0;">#3 TEXAS A&M @ #16 TEXAS | 7:30 PM ET | ABC</h3>
<div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0; color:#aaa;">Darrell K Royal Stadium, Austin | TAMU -2.5 | O/U 51.5</div>

<p>The Lone Star Showdown returns to Austin for the first time since 2010 with enormous stakes. No. 3 Texas A&M (11-0) has their historic undefeated season on the line against No. 16 Texas (8-3). The Aggies haven't started 11-0 since 1992, and Mike Elko has this team playing championship-caliber football. The Longhorns are 2-1 at home in rivalry games this year after beating Oklahoma last month.</p>

<p>Texas A&M is getting 64% of spread bets but only 56.1% implied probability on the moneyline - sharp money sees this as a potential upset spot. The Aggies have been one of the best over teams at 8-2 this season. Texas hasn't hosted this game in 15 years, but the Longhorns took down the Aggies 17-7 when the rivalry resumed last year at Kyle Field. This is the biggest game in the rivalry's recent history.</p>
