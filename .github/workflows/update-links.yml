name: Update Internal Links

# CHANGED Feb 20, 2026: Removed push trigger to stop cascade spam
# This was firing on every push, pushing its own commit, which triggered
# validate-content + auto-fix-content, which pushed more commits...
# Now manual-only. We update links locally via scripts when needed.
