  <h1>About BetLegend</h1>
  <p>BetLegend isn’t a picks service. It’s a movement built on sharp edges, real accountability, and the belief that betting success comes from discipline and data — not hype or guesswork.</p>
  <p>We’re a small team of lifelong bettors, stats junkies, and game obsessives who believe in full transparency. Every pick is posted with a timestamp, every result is tracked publicly on our <a href="betlegend-verified-records.html">Verified Records</a> page.</p>
  <p>We don’t promise wins. We promise effort, honesty, and sharp analysis that respects your bankroll. From MLB to NFL and beyond, we aim to give you real insight, not recycled trends.</p>
  <p>Want to see what’s next? Visit our <a href="upcomingpicks.html">Upcoming Picks</a> page or check out the <a href="blog.html">Daily Blog</a>. Bet smart. Stay sharp. Be legendary.</p>
