<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Browns @ Bears</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 1:00 PM ET | Soldier Field</span>
</div>
<img alt="Chicago Bears" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/chi.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Chicago's turnaround under their new coaching staff has been one of the season's best stories. At 9-4, the Bears are firmly in the playoff picture, with Caleb Williams looking like the franchise quarterback they hoped he'd be. The rookie has matured rapidly, making fewer mistakes while the offensive line has given him time to find his talented receivers.</p>

<p>Cleveland at 3-10 is in full rebuild mode, whether they admit it or not. The quarterback carousel has been a disaster, the offensive line can't protect anyone, and the defense that was supposed to carry this team has regressed significantly. This is a team playing for pride and draft position.</p>

<p>Soldier Field hasn't been friendly to opposing offenses this season. The Bears' defense has been opportunistic, creating turnovers and giving the offense short fields. Cleveland's penchant for mistakes could be their undoing against a team that capitalizes on errors.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Chicago's pass rush against Cleveland's struggling offensive line is a mismatch. Expect the Bears to bring pressure early and force quick decisions. For the Browns, it's about ball security and keeping this game close enough to have a chance late. Any turnovers and this could get ugly fast.</p>

<h2>Ravens @ Bengals</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 1:00 PM ET | Paycor Stadium</span>
</div>
<img alt="Cincinnati Bengals" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/cin.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>The AFC North rivalry continues with massive playoff implications. Lamar Jackson is playing at an MVP level again, combining his otherworldly running ability with a sophisticated passing attack. Derrick Henry has been the perfect complement, wearing down defenses and dominating in short-yardage situations.</p>

<p>Cincinnati desperately needs this win to keep their playoff hopes alive. Joe Burrow has been brilliant despite a supporting cast that's been decimated by injuries. Ja'Marr Chase continues to be the league's most dangerous receiver, capable of taking over any game with his big-play ability.</p>

<p>These teams split their earlier matchup, and this game has all the makings of another classic. Both offenses can score in bunches, and both defenses have shown vulnerability. This could be a high-scoring affair that comes down to the final possession.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>The battle between Lamar and Burrow is must-see television. Both quarterbacks are elite, both teams have explosive receivers, and both defenses can be exploited. Watch for the running game battle - Baltimore's Henry vs. Cincinnati's Chase Brown could determine possession time and game flow.</p>

<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Chargers @ Chiefs</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 1:00 PM ET | Arrowhead Stadium</span>
</div>
<img alt="Kansas City Chiefs" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/kc.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>The AFC West showdown features two teams with playoff aspirations. Jim Harbaugh has transformed the Chargers in his first season, turning them into a physical, disciplined team that competes every week. Justin Herbert is thriving in this new system, making smart decisions and limiting turnovers.</p>

<p>Kansas City continues their dynasty run under Patrick Mahomes. The Chiefs have faced adversity this season but always seem to find a way. Andy Reid has this team playing their best football as the playoffs approach. Arrowhead Stadium will be rocking for this division rivalry.</p>

<p>The Chargers handed the Chiefs a rare loss earlier this season, proving they can compete with the defending champions. Kansas City will be motivated for revenge, and Mahomes has a history of rising to the occasion in big games.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>LA's pass rush against Kansas City's improved offensive line is the key matchup. If the Chargers can pressure Mahomes, they have a chance. If he has time, he'll pick them apart. Watch for Herbert's ability to extend drives and keep the Chiefs' offense on the sideline.</p>

<article class="game-preview">
<div class="game-header">
<img alt="Buffalo Bills" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/buf.png"/>
<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Bills @ Patriots</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 1:00 PM ET | Gillette Stadium</span>
</div>
<img alt="New England Patriots" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/ne.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Buffalo continues to dominate the AFC East with Josh Allen playing at an MVP level. The Bills have been one of the league's most complete teams, with an offense that can score from anywhere and a defense that's improved significantly. Allen has been making impossible throws look routine all season.</p>

<p>New England is in full rebuild mode under new coach Jerod Mayo. Drake Maye has shown flashes of the talent that made him a first-round pick, but the supporting cast is thin. The Patriots are playing for pride and development at this point in the season.</p>

<p>The Bills have dominated this rivalry in recent years, and there's no reason to expect that to change. Buffalo's defense should feast on New England's limited offensive weapons, while Allen will have his pick of targets against a struggling Patriots secondary.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Allen's efficiency against a young Patriots defense will be key. Buffalo should be able to score at will, so the question is whether they can stay disciplined and avoid turnovers. For New England, it's about Maye gaining experience against a playoff-caliber team and showing growth.</p>

<article class="game-preview">
<div class="game-header">
<img alt="Las Vegas Raiders" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/lv.png"/>
<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Raiders @ Eagles</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 1:00 PM ET | Lincoln Financial Field</span>
</div>
<img alt="Philadelphia Eagles" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/phi.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Philadelphia is rolling with Jalen Hurts playing at an MVP level and the defense creating havoc. Saquon Barkley has revitalized the running game, and this Eagles team looks complete on both sides of the ball. Lincoln Financial Field has been one of the toughest environments in football.</p>

<p>Las Vegas is playing out the string in a disappointing season. The Raiders have struggled to find consistency on offense, and the defense has been a mess. This is a team looking toward the offseason and the changes that will come.</p>

<p>The Eagles should dominate this matchup from start to finish. Philadelphia's offensive line against a struggling Raiders front should open massive holes for Barkley, and Hurts will have time to pick apart the secondary.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Can the Eagles avoid a trap game? Philadelphia has everything to play for while Las Vegas has nothing. The key is for the Eagles to stay focused and not overlook a team they should beat handily. Watch for Barkley's workload as Philly controls the clock.</p>

<div class="game-header">
<img alt="Washington Commanders" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/wsh.png"/>
<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Commanders @ Giants</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 1:00 PM ET | MetLife Stadium</span>
</div>
<img alt="New York Giants" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/nyg.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Washington's surprise season continues under first-year coach Dan Quinn. Jayden Daniels has been a revelation, looking like a franchise quarterback from day one. The Commanders have playoff aspirations and need wins in these divisional games to secure their position.</p>

<p>The Giants are having another lost season in what's become a depressing trend. The quarterback situation remains unsettled, and there's little reason for optimism. This is a franchise searching for answers that probably won't come this year.</p>

<p>Washington has owned this rivalry recently, and Daniels gives them another advantage in what should be a comfortable win. The Commanders' defense has improved significantly, creating turnovers and limiting big plays.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Daniels' dual-threat ability against a Giants defense that's struggled against mobile quarterbacks. Washington should be able to score consistently, while New York's offense has struggled to put together complete games. Watch for Terry McLaurin to have a big day against the Giants' secondary.</p>

<div class="game-header">
<img alt="Green Bay Packers" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/gb.png"/>
<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Packers @ Broncos</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 4:25 PM ET | Empower Field at Mile High</span>
</div>
<img alt="Denver Broncos" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/den.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Green Bay's young core has matured rapidly. Jordan Love has taken the next step, looking like a franchise quarterback capable of leading this team deep into January. The receiver room is loaded with talent, and the defense has found its identity late in the season.</p>

<p>Denver's resurgence under Bo Nix has been one of the season's best stories. The rookie quarterback has exceeded expectations, leading the Broncos into playoff contention. Sean Payton has this team playing disciplined, physical football.</p>

<p>The thin Denver air adds a unique element to this matchup. Both offenses should have opportunities, but the altitude can affect kicking and late-game fatigue. Green Bay will need to stay hydrated and manage their energy through four quarters.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Love vs. Nix is a fascinating matchup of young quarterbacks with different styles. Love is more aggressive, while Nix manages games efficiently. Watch for how both defenses handle the opposing passing attacks, and whether the altitude becomes a factor late.</p>

<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Jets @ Jaguars</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 1:00 PM ET | EverBank Stadium</span>
</div>
<img alt="Jacksonville Jaguars" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/jax.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Two struggling franchises meet in Jacksonville in what amounts to a battle for draft positioning. The Jets' season went sideways early and never recovered, with Aaron Rodgers unable to recapture his former magic. The offense has been stagnant, and the defense has regressed from its promising 2024 form.</p>

<p>Jacksonville's rebuild continues under Doug Pederson, though patience is wearing thin. Trevor Lawrence has shown flashes of his potential, but consistency remains elusive. The receiving corps has talent, but the offensive line struggles have limited what this offense can accomplish.</p>

<p>Neither team has much to play for beyond pride, which can make for unpredictable outcomes. Both squads have young players fighting for roster spots next year, and that desperation can lead to unexpected performances.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Can either quarterback make a statement? Both Rodgers and Lawrence have underperformed this season, and this game offers a chance to show something positive. Watch for which team's defense can create turnovers and flip the field.</p>

<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Cardinals @ Texans</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 1:00 PM ET | NRG Stadium</span>
</div>
<img alt="Houston Texans" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/hou.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Houston has established themselves as a legitimate AFC contender in year two of the DeMeco Ryans era. C.J. Stroud continues to play beyond his years, making smart decisions and delivering clutch throws. The Texans' defense has become one of the league's best, creating havoc for opposing offenses.</p>

<p>Arizona has shown improvement under Jonathan Gannon, with Kyler Murray looking healthy and dangerous again. The Cardinals have upset potential against any opponent, and Marvin Harrison Jr. has developed into the star receiver everyone expected. This is a team that can't be overlooked.</p>

<p>The Texans need wins to secure the AFC South title and potential playoff seeding. Arizona is playing spoiler but has legitimate playmakers capable of causing problems. This matchup features two dynamic quarterbacks who can change games with their legs.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Houston's pass rush against Arizona's offensive line is the key matchup. If the Texans can pressure Murray, they'll force mistakes. If Murray has time, he can make explosive plays. Watch for Stroud's connection with his receivers against an improving Cardinals secondary.</p>

<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Lions @ Rams</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 4:25 PM ET | SoFi Stadium</span>
</div>
<img alt="Los Angeles Rams" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/lar.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Detroit enters as one of the league's hottest teams, with Jared Goff orchestrating Dan Campbell's aggressive offense to perfection. The Lions have the NFC's best record and home-field advantage in their sights. Amon-Ra St. Brown and the receiving corps have been electric, while the defense has become championship-caliber.</p>

<p>Los Angeles has battled injuries all season but remains dangerous with Matthew Stafford at the helm. The Rams have playoff aspirations of their own and need wins down the stretch. Puka Nacua has emerged as one of the game's best young receivers, giving Stafford a reliable target.</p>

<p>This is a potential playoff preview between two physical teams. Detroit's offensive line dominance against LA's defensive front will be key. Both teams can score in bunches, setting up a potential shootout at SoFi.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>The ground game battle is crucial. Detroit's Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery have been devastating, while LA's Kyren Williams provides balance. Watch for how both defenses handle third-down situations and whether either team can control time of possession.</p>

</div>
<img alt="New Orleans Saints" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/no.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Carolina continues to develop Bryce Young, hoping the former #1 pick can still become the franchise quarterback they envisioned. There have been glimpses of progress, but consistency remains the challenge. Dave Canales has brought stability, and the roster shows signs of improvement.</p>

<p>New Orleans has had a disappointing season after high expectations. Injuries have decimated the roster, and the offense hasn't found its rhythm. The Saints are playing out the string, looking toward roster decisions that need to be made this offseason.</p>

<p>Both NFC South teams are looking toward the future rather than competing for playoffs. This becomes a development game where young players can gain valuable experience and coaches can evaluate talent for next season.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Young's pocket presence and decision-making remain the focal point for Carolina. Can he show improvement against a struggling Saints defense? For New Orleans, it's about which young players step up and make a case for bigger roles going forward.</p>

<p>San Francisco has battled through injuries that would derail most teams. Kyle Shanahan continues to find ways to win, and the 49ers remain in the playoff picture despite losing key players. The depth of this roster has been tested and has largely held up.</p>

<p>Tennessee is in the midst of a difficult rebuilding year. Will Levis has shown raw talent but needs time to develop consistency. The Titans are building for the future, and this season is about gaining experience and identifying core pieces for the next era.</p>

<p>The 49ers should control this game with their schematic advantages and superior talent. San Francisco's defense can take the ball away, and their offense can score in creative ways even without all their stars healthy.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Can Tennessee's defense slow down the 49ers' misdirection and motion offense? Shanahan's system can confuse even veteran defenses, so the young Titans will be tested. Watch for San Francisco's ground game to establish itself early and control tempo.</p>

<h2>Colts @ Seahawks</h2>

<div class="preview-content">
<p>Indianapolis has shown fight all season despite inconsistent results. Anthony Richardson's ceiling remains tantalizing, though injuries have limited his development. When healthy, he's one of the most physically gifted quarterbacks in the league. The Colts need wins to keep any playoff hopes alive.</p>

<p>Seattle is in a tight NFC West race and needs home victories. Geno Smith has proven he's a legitimate starting quarterback, making plays both with his arm and his legs. The Seahawks' defense has been opportunistic, and Lumen Field's crowd provides a distinct advantage.</p>

<p>This game has sneaky playoff implications for both teams. Indianapolis has the talent to upset anyone, while Seattle needs every win to secure a postseason berth. The 12th Man will make communication difficult for the Colts' offense.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Richardson's health and mobility will determine Indiana's offensive ceiling. If he's fully healthy, his athleticism can open up the playbook. Seattle's secondary against the Colts' receivers is a key matchup, and watch for DK Metcalf's impact against a vulnerable Indianapolis secondary.</p>

<h2>Vikings @ Cowboys</h2>

<div class="preview-content">
<p>Minnesota has been the NFL's biggest surprise, with Sam Darnold playing the best football of his career. The Vikings' offense has been explosive, and the defense has created turnovers at a remarkable rate. Kevin O'Connell deserves serious Coach of the Year consideration for this transformation.</p>

<p>Dallas's season has been a disaster. Dak Prescott's injury ended any playoff hopes, and the team has fallen apart without their franchise quarterback. The Cowboys are playing out the string, with major questions about the future direction of this franchise looming.</p>

<p>This is a showcase game on Sunday Night Football, but the narratives couldn't be more different. Minnesota is proving they're legitimate contenders, while Dallas is trying to salvage pride from a lost season.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Darnold against a demoralized Cowboys defense could be a mismatch. Minnesota should be able to move the ball at will, while Dallas's offense without Prescott has been limited. Watch for Justin Jefferson to dominate what's left of Dallas's secondary in a statement game for the Vikings.</p>
