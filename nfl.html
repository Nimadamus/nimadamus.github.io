<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Browns @ Bears</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 1:00 PM ET | Soldier Field</span>
</div>
<img alt="Chicago Bears" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/chi.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Chicago's turnaround under their new coaching staff has been one of the season's best stories. At 9-4, the Bears are firmly in the playoff picture, with Caleb Williams looking like the franchise quarterback they hoped he'd be. The rookie has matured rapidly, making fewer mistakes while the offensive line has given him time to find his talented receivers.</p>

<p>Cleveland at 3-10 is in full rebuild mode, whether they admit it or not. The quarterback carousel has been a disaster, the offensive line can't protect anyone, and the defense that was supposed to carry this team has regressed significantly. This is a team playing for pride and draft position.</p>

<p>Soldier Field hasn't been friendly to opposing offenses this season. The Bears' defense has been opportunistic, creating turnovers and giving the offense short fields. Cleveland's penchant for mistakes could be their undoing against a team that capitalizes on errors.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Chicago's pass rush against Cleveland's struggling offensive line is a mismatch. Expect the Bears to bring pressure early and force quick decisions. For the Browns, it's about ball security and keeping this game close enough to have a chance late. Any turnovers and this could get ugly fast.</p>

<div class="game-header">
<img alt="Baltimore Ravens" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/bal.png"/>
<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Ravens @ Giants</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 1:00 PM ET | MetLife Stadium</span>
</div>
<img alt="New York Giants" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/nyg.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Lamar Jackson is playing at an MVP level again. The Ravens' offense is clicking on all cylinders, combining Jackson's otherworldly running ability with a passing game that's become increasingly sophisticated. Derrick Henry has been the perfect complement, wearing down defenses and keeping drives alive on third and short.</p>

<p>The Giants are having another lost season in what's become a depressing trend. The quarterback situation remains unsettled, the defense can't stop the run, and there's little reason for optimism. This is a franchise searching for answers that probably won't come this year.</p>

<p>Baltimore's running game against New York's porous run defense is a nightmare matchup for the Giants. Henry and Jackson will likely combine for 200+ rushing yards if the Ravens want to dominate the clock and keep their defense fresh.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Can the Giants generate any pass rush? If Jackson has time, he'll pick them apart. New York needs to make Baltimore one-dimensional, which is nearly impossible against this offense. Watch for Lamar's decision-making on read options - the Giants have struggled mightily against mobile quarterbacks all season.</p>

<div class="game-header">
<img alt="Dallas Cowboys" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/dal.png"/>
<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Cowboys @ Panthers</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 1:00 PM ET | Bank of America Stadium</span>
</div>
<img alt="Carolina Panthers" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/car.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Dallas has been a massive disappointment this season after entering with Super Bowl expectations. The offensive line has been ravaged by injuries, Dak Prescott hasn't looked right, and the defense that was supposed to be elite has been merely average. Jerry Jones is facing hard questions about the direction of this franchise.</p>

<p>Carolina continues their rebuild with Bryce Young at the helm. The second-year quarterback has shown improvement, though the supporting cast remains thin. The Panthers are playing hard but lack the talent to compete consistently. This is about development and building for the future.</p>

<p>Neither team enters this game with confidence, making it a true wildcard. Dallas has more talent on paper, but their underperformance has been shocking. Carolina has nothing to lose and will play loose against a Cowboys team that looks mentally defeated.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Dallas needs to establish CeeDee Lamb early. He's been the one consistent weapon, but he needs targets to make an impact. Carolina's secondary has been exploitable, which should give Prescott opportunities. For the Panthers, containing the Dallas passing game and forcing them to grind out drives is the path to an upset.</p>

<div class="game-header">
<img alt="Kansas City Chiefs" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/kc.png"/>
<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Chiefs @ Texans</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 4:25 PM ET | NRG Stadium</span>
</div>
<img alt="Houston Texans" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/hou.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Patrick Mahomes continues to do Patrick Mahomes things. The Chiefs look like Super Bowl favorites again, with an offense that's dangerous and a defense that's improved significantly. Andy Reid has this team peaking at the right time, and nobody wants to face Kansas City in January.</p>

<p>Houston's emergence under CJ Stroud has been one of the league's best stories. The second-year quarterback has poise beyond his experience, making plays in the pocket and connecting with his receivers downfield. The Texans have legitimate playoff aspirations and this is a chance to make a statement.</p>

<p>This is the kind of game that separates contenders from pretenders. Houston needs to prove they can hang with the best, and there's no better test than Mahomes and the Chiefs. Kansas City will bring pressure and disguise coverages, testing Stroud's decision-making.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Stroud against Kansas City's complex defensive schemes is the matchup to watch. Steve Spagnuolo will dial up looks Stroud hasn't seen, forcing him to process quickly. For the Chiefs, it's about Mahomes being Mahomes - he has a way of making the decisive play when it matters most.</p>

<article class="game-preview">
<div class="game-header">
<img alt="Pittsburgh Steelers" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/pit.png"/>
<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Steelers @ Eagles</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 4:25 PM ET | Lincoln Financial Field</span>
</div>
<img alt="Philadelphia Eagles" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/phi.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>The Pennsylvania rivalry adds playoff implications this year. Philadelphia is rolling, with Jalen Hurts playing at an MVP level and the defense creating havoc. Saquon Barkley has revitalized the running game, and this Eagles team looks complete on both sides of the ball.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh has been solid if unspectacular, grinding out wins with their defense and opportunistic offense. Russell Wilson has been competent, if not spectacular, and the Steelers play their brand of physical football regardless of opponent. This is a team that won't beat itself.</p>

<p>Lincoln Financial Field will be rocking for this one. The Eagles have been dominant at home, feeding off their passionate fanbase. Pittsburgh will need to weather the early storm and keep this close to have a chance late.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Philadelphia's offensive line against Pittsburgh's front seven is the key matchup. If the Eagles can run the ball effectively, they'll control the clock and keep Hurts in manageable situations. The Steelers need to win the turnover battle and create short fields for their offense.</p>

<article class="game-preview">
<div class="game-header">
<img alt="Buffalo Bills" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/buf.png"/>
<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Bills @ Lions</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 4:25 PM ET | Ford Field</span>
</div>
<img alt="Detroit Lions" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/det.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>This has all the makings of a playoff preview. Buffalo and Detroit are two of the most complete teams in football, with explosive offenses and defenses that have improved significantly. Josh Allen vs. Jared Goff is a contrast in styles - Allen the gunslinger, Goff the efficient game manager.</p>

<p>Detroit has embraced the aggressive mentality that makes them dangerous. Dan Campbell goes for it on fourth down, calls aggressive plays in big moments, and has this team believing they can beat anyone. Ford Field has become one of the toughest environments in football.</p>

<p>Buffalo has been doing Buffalo things under Sean McDermott - winning with a balanced attack and a defense that creates turnovers. Allen has been brilliant, making impossible throws look routine. This is a team with Super Bowl aspirations.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>The turnover battle will decide this game. Both teams have playmakers on defense who can create takeaways. Allen's aggressive style can lead to mistakes against a Lions defense that's learned to bait quarterbacks into bad decisions. For Detroit, it's about protecting Goff and letting him operate in rhythm.</p>

<article class="game-preview">
<div class="game-header">
<img alt="Green Bay Packers" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/gb.png"/>
<div class="matchup-info">
<h2>Packers @ Seahawks</h2>
<span class="game-time">Sunday, 8:20 PM ET | Lumen Field</span>
</div>
<img alt="Seattle Seahawks" class="team-logo" src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/scoreboard/sea.png"/>
</div>
<div class="preview-content">
<p>Green Bay's young core has matured rapidly. Jordan Love has taken the next step, looking like a franchise quarterback capable of leading this team deep into January. The receiver room is loaded with talent, and the defense has found its identity late in the season.</p>

<p>Seattle has been inconsistent, with flashes of brilliance followed by head-scratching losses. Geno Smith has been solid, but the team lacks the explosive playmakers to keep up in shootouts. The defense has been the bigger concern, giving up too many big plays.</p>

<p>Lumen Field on a Sunday night is a difficult environment. The 12th Man is real, and the crowd noise can disrupt opposing offenses. Green Bay will need to handle the noise and execute their game plan despite the chaos.</p>

<p class="section-header">What to Watch</p>
<p>Love's ability to handle the moment will be tested. Prime time, hostile environment, playoff implications - this is where you separate the good quarterbacks from the great ones. Seattle needs their pass rush to get home and make Love uncomfortable. If he has time, the Packers will score.</p>
