  <h1>NFL Betting Picks and Analysis</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the NFL section of BetLegend — where sharp insights meet raw gridiron matchups. Every Sunday brings chaos, and we’re here to make sense of it all with transparent, number-backed betting picks and strategy.</p>
  <p>We break down key edges weekly, from quarterback matchups and O-line performance to weather factors and market movement. NFL sides, totals, and player props are all in play, depending on where the value lands.</p>
  <p>Each week, you'll find breakdowns on:
    <ul>
      <li>ATS trends for every matchup</li>
      <li>Red zone efficiency and pace of play</li>
      <li>Sharp vs public betting indicators</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>All picks are tracked publicly on our <a href="betlegend-verified-records.html">Verified Records</a> page. See what’s coming on the <a href="upcomingpicks.html">Upcoming Picks</a> board or read our full analysis on the <a href="blog.html">Blog</a>.
