<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px; color: gray;">6:04 AM, October 23, 2025</p>
<div>
<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">This is not how anyone expected the NBA season to start. Federal authorities arrested Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier Thursday morning in what's shaping up to be one of the biggest gambling scandals the league has ever seen. And based on what we're hearing, this thing might just be getting started.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">Rozier got picked up at a hotel in Orlando early Thursday. The Heat had just played the Magic Wednesday night, and while Rozier was in uniform, he never saw the floor. FBI agents apparently waited until after the game to make their move, which tells you they'd been tracking him for a while. By sunrise, he was in federal custody.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">Billups got arrested in Oregon after coaching the Blazers in their season opener against the Timberwolves. The Hall of Famer was on the sideline Wednesday night like nothing was wrong. Less than 12 hours later, federal agents were at his door. Law enforcement sources say his case involves an illegal poker ring with ties to organized crime, which is about as serious as it gets.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">The Rozier situation goes back to a game in March 2023 when he was still with the Hornets. Charlotte was playing New Orleans, and Rozier started the game like usual. He played nine and a half minutes, put up five points, four rebounds, and two assists. Then he left with what the team called a foot injury. Never came back that night. Never played another game that season.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">At first, nobody thought much of it. The Hornets were going nowhere, playoffs were out of reach, so shutting down a veteran early made sense. But then people started looking at the betting markets. Rozier's numbers from that first quarter were way under what his player props had been set at. When word got out he wasn't coming back, social media went crazy. Bettors were furious, calling it shady, saying something didn't add up.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">Turns out those suspicions made it to the FBI. The NBA did its own investigation back then and said they didn't find anything wrong. But federal authorities kept digging. Rozier's lawyer said his client cooperated with everyone, met with the NBA and the FBI multiple times, and was told there was no issue. Clearly, that changed.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">The Billups case is separate but connected, according to sources. Details are still coming out, but it sounds like federal investigators found an underground poker operation running with people linked to organized crime. Whether Billups knew about the mob connections or how deep he was in all this, we don't know yet. But being arrested by the FBI is never a good look.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">And it doesn't stop there. Former NBA player Damon Jones got arrested Thursday morning in Las Vegas. Jones played for Cleveland and other teams before becoming an assistant coach. Now he's caught up in this mess too. The feds are clearly going after a whole network here, not just one or two guys.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">FBI Director Kash Patel and officials from the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York are holding a press conference later today to lay out the charges. Word is that members of organized crime groups are among a couple dozen people facing charges across two related cases. This thing is bigger than just basketball.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">For the NBA, this is an absolute disaster. The league has worked for years to partner with legal sportsbooks and build trust around regulated betting. They've pushed the message that gambling can coexist with the integrity of the game. These arrests blow a hole right through that narrative. How do you tell fans the games are clean when a coach and a player just got arrested for illegal gambling?</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">This also brings back memories of last year's Jontay Porter situation. The former Raptors forward pleaded guilty to wire fraud after admitting he tanked his own performance to help gamblers cash in. Porter got banned for life and is waiting to be sentenced in December. That case was handled by the same U.S. Attorney's office running the Billups and Rozier investigations, which means the feds are clearly making this a priority.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">Neither the Blazers nor the Heat have said anything publicly. The NBA hasn't put out a statement yet either. Rozier is supposed to appear in federal court in Orlando this afternoon. Billups will have his first court appearance in Oregon. We still don't know the exact charges, but wire fraud, conspiracy, and federal gambling violations seem like the obvious suspects given what's been reported.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">For Billups, this is a brutal fall. The guy got inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame just last year. He was Mr. Big Shot, the Finals MVP who led Detroit to a championship in 2004. He was respected everywhere he went. Now his entire legacy is in jeopardy. You can't erase what he did on the court, but this will define how people remember him moving forward.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">Rozier built a solid career as Scary Terry, the playoff performer who came up big when it mattered. He's making $26 million this season in the final year of a four year deal he signed with Charlotte back in 2021. Miami brought him in to help chase a championship. Instead, he's facing federal charges before the season even gets going.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">The timing couldn't be worse. Opening night of the NBA season, and we're talking about arrests instead of basketball. Commissioner Adam Silver has always supported legal betting but warned constantly about the risks of corruption. Well, here we are. The nightmare scenario he's been worried about is playing out in real time.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">Bigger questions are already starting to bubble up. How many people are involved in this? Are there other players or coaches under investigation? Is this just the tip of the iceberg? And what happens to the NBA's relationship with the betting industry now that federal authorities are arresting people connected to the league?</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px; color: #f2f2f2; line-height: 1.65;">Right now, the story moves to the courtroom. The cases against Billups, Rozier, and everyone else will unfold over the coming weeks and months. The NBA will be watching. Fans will be watching. And everyone is hoping this doesn't get any worse than it already is. But if history is any guide, it probably will.</p>
