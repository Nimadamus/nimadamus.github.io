Leading the 2025 NBA Finals 3–2 over the Indiana Pacers, the Thunder will attempt to close out the series tonight in front of their home crowd at Paycom Center. A win would deliver the franchise its first NBA championship since the Seattle SuperSonics' 1979 title — and the first for OKC since relocating.  </p></div>`
