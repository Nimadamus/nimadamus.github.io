    The Oklahoma City Thunder are one win away from completing one of the most impressive rebuild-to-title arcs in modern NBA history. Leading the 2025 NBA Finals 3–2 over the Indiana Pacers, the Thunder will attempt to close out the series tonight in front of their home crowd at Paycom Center. A win would deliver the franchise its first NBA championship since the Seattle SuperSonics' 1979 title — and the first for OKC since relocating.
