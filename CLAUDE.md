# CLAUDE.md - MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS FOR EVERY SESSION

## CRITICAL: READ BEFORE DOING ANYTHING

**This file is automatically loaded at the start of every Claude Code session in this repository.**

---

## STEP 1: ALWAYS READ THE PROTOCOL FIRST

Before creating ANY content for this website, you MUST read:
- `POSTING_PROTOCOL.md` - Contains mandatory verification checklist

**Run this command at the start of every session:**
```
Read POSTING_PROTOCOL.md sections 1 and 1A
```

## STEP 2: MANDATORY VERIFICATION FOR SLATE POSTS

If the user asks you to create a slate post (NBA, NHL, NFL, NCAAB, MLB), you MUST:

1. **VERIFY TOTAL GAME COUNT FIRST**
   - Search ESPN/official schedule for the EXACT date
   - COUNT every single game
   - Do NOT write until you have the exact count

2. **VERIFY EVERY PLAYER-TEAM ASSOCIATION**
   - Search to confirm each player is on the team you mention
   - Check for 2025 trades (many players changed teams)

3. **VERIFY ALL INJURIES**
   - Search exact injury type (ACL vs Achilles matters!)
   - Confirm current status

4. **VERIFY ALL STATS AND RECORDS**
   - Never guess - search and verify everything

## STEP 5: AFTER MAKING CHANGES

Always push to GitHub after completing work:
```bash
git -C "C:\Users\Nima\nimadamus.github.io" add [files]
git -C "C:\Users\Nima\nimadamus.github.io" commit -m "[description]"
git -C "C:\Users\Nima\nimadamus.github.io" push
```

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **ACCURACY OVER SPEED** - It's better to take time and verify than to publish errors
2. **NEVER GUESS** - If you can't verify, ask the user or omit the detail
3. **COUNT ALL GAMES** - Never claim "X-game slate" without verifying exact count
4. **CHECK ROSTERS** - Players change teams; always verify current team
5. **VERIFY INJURIES** - ACL and Achilles are different; details matter

---

**One false claim destroys credibility. Verify everything.**
