  <h1>NBA Picks and Betting Analysis</h1>
  <p>The NBA moves fast — and so do the lines. At BetLegend, we track pace, player rotations, market steam, and sharp indicators to bring you daily basketball picks with real edge. This isn’t guesswork — it’s matchup-based, trend-informed analysis built to cash.</p>
  <p>We focus on everything from totals and spreads to quarters, halves, and live betting angles. NBA betting is all about rhythm and timing — both on the court and in the market.</p>
  <p>Our NBA strategy includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Tracking back-to-backs and travel fatigue</li>
      <li>Monitoring injury reports and rest days</li>
      <li>Analyzing offensive pace and defensive efficiency</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
