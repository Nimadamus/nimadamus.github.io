  <h1>2024–25 NBA Season Recap & Offseason Outlook</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Thunder Capture Their First NBA Championship</h2>
    <p>
      The 2024–25 NBA season has officially wrapped, and what a ride it was for basketball fans and bettors. The Oklahoma City Thunder delivered one of the most memorable playoff runs in years, claiming their first NBA championship in franchise history. Led by the breakout stardom of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the continued emergence of Chet Holmgren, the Thunder stormed through the Western Conference and took down the battle-tested Boston Celtics in a six-game Finals. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oklahoma City’s blend of youthful energy and veteran poise was the story of the postseason. Their defense turned up a notch in every clutch moment, with Jalen Williams and Lu Dort locking down the perimeter and Holmgren owning the paint. Mark Daigneault out-coached nearly everyone along the way, pulling the right levers at the perfect times. For bettors who stuck with OKC futures early, this run paid off big time.

    <h2>Free Agency Rumors: An Offseason Like No Other</h2>
    <p>
      With the draft already behind us, NBA free agency is about to get chaotic. Teams are stacking up cap space and eyeing big names, but there’s a real sense that this summer could reshape the power balance across the league. Several All-Stars could be on the move, and role players who played key minutes in the playoffs are about to get paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thunder are rumored to be looking for one more stretch forward to add shooting and depth. Meanwhile, contenders like the Lakers and Heat are desperate to get younger and more athletic. Boston is expected to keep their core together, but a surprise blockbuster is always just one tweet away this time of year.

    <h2>The Countdown to Opening Night</h2>
    <p>
      Believe it or not, opening night for the 2025–26 NBA season is only about four months away. Training camps will be here before you know it, and with summer league heating up, rookies and sophomores are already battling for roster spots and playing time. Every offseason goes by faster than you expect, and this one feels especially unpredictable with all the moving pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bettors, stay alert for win total markets and early futures, especially for teams that make big splashes in free agency or land key pieces in late trades. Last year’s preseason favorites did not all deliver, so watch for sharp early movement and try to get ahead of the steam.

    <h2>Spotlight: Where Will Jonathan Kuminga Land?</h2>
    <p>
      One of the hottest storylines this summer is the future of Jonathan Kuminga. After showing flashes of brilliance for Golden State, Kuminga is now at the center of trade rumors with half the league reportedly interested in his upside. He has the athleticism, strength, and offensive toolkit to become an All-Star, and some insiders believe he just needs the right environment to put it all together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep an eye on where Kuminga ends up—he could change the fortunes of a playoff team overnight. The Thunder, Magic, and Bulls are all rumored destinations, and whoever lands him is going to get a player ready to break out. This is a name you’ll want to watch not just for highlight reels, but also for season-long props and daily fantasy plays next year.
