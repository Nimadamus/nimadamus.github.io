    <h1>2024–25 NHL Season Recap</h1>
    
        <p>Another hockey season in the books. The 2024–25 NHL campaign was packed with sharp totals, first-period angles, and goalie splits that helped us stay ahead of the market.</p>
        <p>We’ll be back in the fall with more focused NHL plays, trend breakdowns, and day-by-day value picks — just like we do in baseball and football.</p>
        <p>Until then, catch up on our <a href="blog.html">Blog</a> or visit the <a href="betlegend-verified-records.html">Verified Records</a> page to review every pick, win or loss.</p>
        <p>We skate again soon. See you next season.</p>
