    <h1>2024–25 NHL Season Recap</h1>

    <p>The 2024–25 NHL season was nothing short of thrilling. From breakout rookies to veteran goalies locking down the crease, we saw plenty of action that kept bettors and fans alike on their toes. Sharp totals, first-period trends, and goalie matchups consistently provided opportunities to stay ahead of the market.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest stories was how defensive systems evolved, with teams emphasizing shot suppression and smart penalty kills, which had a direct impact on betting lines and totals. We closely tracked these tactical shifts, leveraging advanced stats to pinpoint value in tight games and over/under plays.</p>

    <p>Goaltender performance was another critical factor this season. Goalies like [Insert notable goalie names or stats here] made huge differences, turning otherwise risky bets into consistent winners. Our models adapted to these trends, factoring in save percentages by period and against different shot types, allowing us to capitalize on the nuances that casual bettors often miss.</p>

    <p>As the season wrapped up, we refined our strategy to focus on late-season trends and playoff implications, where intensity and line matching become paramount. We’ll bring this expertise and sharp analysis back for the next NHL season, ensuring you have the best edge possible for your hockey bets.</p>
