<h3 class="game-title">Dallas Stars (17-5-4) @ New Jersey Devils</h3>
<div class="game-meta">

<span>Prudential Center</span>
<span>ESPN+</span>
</div>
<p>The Dallas Stars are on an absolute tear right now, and the numbers back it up. At 17-5-4, they've got the second-best record in Dallas history and third-best in franchise history through 26 games. This is a team firing on all cylinders, and Jason Robertson is leading the charge in spectacular fashion.</p>

<p>Robertson was just named the NHL's Second Star of the Month for November, and the numbers are staggering. He led the entire league with 13 goals in November and tied for the lead in points with 26 across 15 games. On the season, Robertson has 16 goals and 35 points through 26 appearances with a plus-13 rating. He scored in nine of his 15 November games, including a career-best seven consecutive games. When Robertson's cooking like this, Dallas is virtually unbeatable.</p>

<p>The Devils are dealing with a devastating injury situation. Jack Hughes is out for approximately eight weeks after undergoing finger surgery following a freak accident at a team dinner on November 15th. Before the injury, Hughes had 10 goals and 20 points through 17 games. Losing your franchise center changes everything about how a team operates, and New Jersey's been trying to find their identity without him.</p>

<p>Here's what makes this matchup so lopsided: Dallas is the hottest team in hockey walking into a building where the home team is missing their best player. The Stars have 17 different players with goals in November alone, all 22 skaters have tallied a point. That depth is elite, and it means you can't just focus on shutting down Robertson. Wyatt Johnston, Roope Hintz, and the rest of the forward corps are all dangerous.</p>

<p>Jake Oettinger has been rock solid in net for Dallas, including a shutout earlier in the season. When you've got elite goaltending backing up the best offense in the West, you've got a Stanley Cup contender. The Devils need Jack Hughes back desperately, but he won't be returning until January at the earliest.</p>

<p>Take Dallas here. The Stars are playing championship-caliber hockey, and the Devils simply don't have the firepower without Hughes to hang with them. Stars cover on the road.</p>

<h3 class="game-title">Buffalo Sabres (11-11-4) @ Philadelphia Flyers (14-8-3)</h3>
<div class="game-meta">
<span>7:30 PM ET</span>
<span>Wells Fargo Center</span>
<span>TNT</span>
</div>
<p>This is your nationally televised game of the night on TNT, and the Flyers are defying every preseason expectation. Philadelphia sits at 14-8-3 with five wins in their last seven games, and they're in legitimate playoff position in the Metropolitan Division. Nobody saw this coming, and yet here we are.</p>

<p>The Flyers are playing stout defensive hockey and grinding out wins against anybody who steps into Wells Fargo Center. They're 8-4-2 at home this season, and the atmosphere in that building has been electric. Trevor Zegras, who came over in a change-of-scenery trade, has been thriving in Philadelphia. That move is paying dividends for the Flyers, and the supporting cast has bought into the system completely.</p>

<p>Buffalo comes in at 11-11-4, which is right around .500 hockey. The Sabres have won two in a row heading into this matchup, but they've been inconsistent all season. This is a franchise that's been rebuilding for what feels like forever, and while they've got talented young players, they haven't figured out how to consistently compete against playoff-caliber teams.</p>

<p>Here's the angle: Philadelphia's playing with confidence and purpose at home. They've found an identity that works, and they're not backing down from anybody. Buffalo's road record has been mediocre, and walking into Wells Fargo against a motivated Flyers team on national television is a tough draw.</p>

<p>The Flyers' defensive structure is going to be the difference. They're not giving up easy chances, they're blocking shots, and they're making teams earn everything they get. Buffalo can score when they're clicking, but they're going to have to work for every inch of ice tonight.</p>

<p>I'm taking Philadelphia at home. The Flyers have been one of the best stories of the season, and they're not slowing down. Flyers cover on TNT.</p>

<h3 class="game-title">Winnipeg Jets (13-12-0) @ Montreal Canadiens (13-8-3)</h3>
<div class="game-meta">
<span>7:30 PM ET</span>
<span>Bell Centre</span>
<span>ESPN+</span>
</div>
<p>The Jets have been wildly inconsistent lately, and their recent road trip tells the whole story. Winnipeg is 13-12-0 overall and 7-7-0 on the road. Their last five games show the volatility: a brutal 5-1 loss at Buffalo, followed by a solid 5-2 win in Nashville, but three straight defeats before that against Carolina, Washington, and Minnesota. This is a team searching for consistency.</p>

<p>Here's the biggest issue for Winnipeg: Connor Hellebuyck is on injured reserve and won't return until early January. When you lose one of the best goalies in the world, it changes everything. Even with Hellebuyck's strong 2.51 GAA and .913 save percentage before the injury, the Jets have been struggling. Without him? They're vulnerable.</p>

<p>Mark Scheifele continues to lead the offense with 32 points, 13 goals, and 19 assists, and the Jets' power play at 22.1 percent is above average. But defensively they're allowing 3.00 goals per game and 29.2 shots, which is concerning without their number one goalie available.</p>

<p>Montreal sits at 13-8-3 and is third in the Atlantic Division. The Canadiens have been competitive all season, and the Bell Centre is always a difficult place to play. The crowd gets loud, the atmosphere is intense, and Montreal feeds off that energy. This is a young team that's ahead of schedule in their rebuild.</p>

<p>With Hellebuyck out, this becomes a much more interesting game. The Jets have the offensive talent to win, but they're going to be exposed defensively against a Montreal team that can score. The Canadiens at home should be able to capitalize on Winnipeg's goaltending situation.</p>

<p>I'm leaning Montreal here. The Bell Centre advantage plus Winnipeg's goaltending issues makes this a favorable spot for the Canadiens. Take Montreal at home.</p>

<img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/nhl/500/scoreboard/ana.png" alt="Anaheim Ducks" class="team-logo">
</div>
<h3 class="game-title">Utah Mammoth (12-12-3) @ Anaheim Ducks (16-9-1)</h3>
<div class="game-meta">
<span>10:00 PM ET</span>
<span>Honda Center</span>
<span>TNT</span>
</div>
<p>This is a showcase of two of the best young talents in the NHL. Logan Cooley leads the Utah Mammoth with 23 points on 14 goals and 9 assists, while Leo Carlsson leads the Anaheim Ducks with a stunning 36 points on 14 goals and 22 assists. Carlsson is tied with Connor McDavid for fourth in the entire NHL. These are two players under 21 who are proving they belong among the league's elite scorers.</p>

<p>The Ducks have been one of the pleasant surprises of the season at 16-9-1. Anaheim is playing winning hockey at Honda Center, and Carlsson has been the engine driving this offense. When your young star is putting up McDavid-type numbers, you've got something special brewing in Orange County.</p>

<p>Utah, playing their first season as the Mammoth after rebranding from the Utah Hockey Club, sits at 12-12-3. It's been a learning experience for this franchise as they establish their identity, and Cooley has been the bright spot throughout. He's got that dynamic, offensive creativity that makes him dangerous every time he touches the puck.</p>

<p>Here's why I like Anaheim: they're at home, they've got the better record, and Carlsson is playing at an elite level. The Ducks have found a winning formula this season, and the young core is playing with confidence. Utah's been competitive, but they're still figuring things out on the road.</p>

<p>This late-night matchup on TNT is going to be fun because of the young talent on display. But from a betting perspective, Anaheim has all the advantages: home ice, a better record, and a young star who's outplaying everyone his age in the league. Take the Ducks at home.</p>

<h3 class="game-title">Washington Capitals (16-9-2) @ San Jose Sharks</h3>
<div class="game-meta">
<span>10:00 PM ET</span>
<span>SAP Center</span>
<span>ESPN+</span>
</div>
<p>Alex Ovechkin is hunting history, and every goal he scores brings him closer to immortality. The Great Eight has 909 career goals, the most in NHL history, and he's on pace to add to that legendary total every night he takes the ice. Tonight, he faces Macklin Celebrini and the San Jose Sharks in what should be a showcase of hockey past and future.</p>

<p>Ovechkin has 12 goals this season and is on pace for 30-plus for the twentieth time in his NHL career. Think about that for a second. Twenty seasons of scoring 30 or more goals. The consistency, the durability, the sheer will to score is unmatched in hockey history. Every time Washington takes the ice, there's a chance we witness history.</p>

<p>The Capitals are sitting at 16-9-2 and playing confident hockey. They've got enough offensive firepower beyond Ovechkin to compete with anybody, and their defense has been solid enough to keep them in games. This is a team that knows how to win, and they're dangerous in December.</p>

<p>San Jose's in a different place. They're in full rebuild mode, and while Celebrini is an exciting young talent who gives fans hope for the future, the present is about development and growth. The Sharks are going to battle hard at SAP Center, but they're overmatched against a veteran Capitals team.</p>

<p>Here's the reality: Washington's the better team by a significant margin. Ovechkin's chasing history, the Caps are playing well, and San Jose doesn't have the depth to compete for forty minutes. This is a get-right game for Washington on the West Coast.</p>

<p>Take the Capitals on the road. Ovechkin's going to get his opportunities, and Washington's too experienced to let this one slip away. Caps cover at SAP Center.</p>
