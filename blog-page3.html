        <div class="post-header">• MLB Best Bets 7/10: Braves & Rays Moneyline Picks</div>
        <div class="post-time">Posted: 2:42 PM – July 10, 2025</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <img alt="Braves vs Rays picks for July 10, 2025" src="bravesrays.png" style="width:100%; max-width:750px;"/>
            <p>We've already got our Mariners First 5 bet locked in, but let's round out the July 10 card with two more plays that check all the boxes statistically.</p>
            <p>Braves moneyline full game at -182 is the first. Spencer Strider is coming off three straight strong starts and enters today with 63 strikeouts in 55 innings. Atlanta's offense is waking up after a quiet stretch, and they've won five of their last seven games against teams with losing records. Oakland ranks near the bottom of the league in batting average and bullpen ERA. If Strider can settle in early, this one has a good chance to cruise.</p>
            <p>The other play is Rays First 5 innings moneyline at -115. Taj Bradley gets the nod, and he's allowed two earned runs or fewer in three of his last four starts. Tampa Bay has cashed the F5 line in 13 of their last 22 games, showing strong value in early spots. The Dodgers have been vulnerable early in games lately, and this feels like the right time to back a focused Rays starter before the bullpen becomes a factor.</p>
            <p>Three picks on the slate for today, and each one has a clear angle. Let's finish strong.</p>
            <p><strong>Full card for July 10:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Mariners First 5 ML -160</li>
                <li>2. Braves ML -182 (full game)</li>
                <li>3. Rays First 5 ML -115</li>
            </ul>

            <img alt="Bryan Woo pitching analysis for Mariners vs Yankees pick" src="woo1.png" style="width:100%; max-width:750px;"/>
            <p>Seattle sends Bryan Woo to the mound tonight at Yankee Stadium, and that's been a green light situation all season. Woo comes into this matchup with a sharp 2.78 ERA and excellent command, facing a Yankees lineup that's struggled early in games when Stroman starts. Stroman's ERA has ballooned to 7.58, and New York is giving up runs in bunches during the first half of contests.</p>
            <p>Seattle's bullpen has been shaky at times, so I don't want any part of the full game line. I'm locking in on the first five innings where the Mariners have a huge advantage on the mound. Stroman has been getting crushed in the opening frames and Woo has held opponents scoreless through the first three innings in five of his last six starts.</p>
            <p>The Yankees have gone over the total in ten straight games and are hitting well late, but early on they've been outmatched. The safer edge tonight is playing Seattle early while the arms are fresh. I'll ride with the hotter starter and take Mariners First 5 innings moneyline at -160.</p>

        <div class="post-header">• Reds vs Marlins Pick 7/9: First 5 Innings Prediction</div>
        <div class="post-time">Posted: 11:09 AM – July 9th, 2025</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <img src="aa.png" alt="Reds vs Marlins MLB betting pick for July 9, 2025" style="width:100%; max-width:750px;"/>
            <p>The Reds are sending Andrew Abbott to the mound today, a lefty with a 3.41 ERA and 84 strikeouts through 92 innings. He's allowed just 2 runs over his last 11.2 innings pitched, both strong outings against the Yankees and Brewers.</p>
            <p>Sandy Alcantara goes for the Marlins. He's been a mess this season with an ERA north of 7 and a WHIP above 1.50. He hasn't pitched since May and is returning from a long layoff. His 2025 road ERA is even worse than his overall numbers.</p>
            <p>Cincinnati has been hot early. Over the past 10 games, they've outscored opponents 22–9 in the first five innings. Miami, on the other hand, is averaging just 1.8 runs through five innings during their current 11-game road losing streak.</p>
            <p>With a red-hot first-half offense and a lefty who's pounding the zone against a shaky and rusty Alcantara, this is a sharp first-five moneyline play. Reds -135 looks like a good value based on recent form and matchup dynamics.</p>

        <div class="post-header">• Giants vs Phillies MLB Pick & Prediction for July 8, 2025</div>
        <div class="post-time">Posted: 11:11 AM – July 8, 2025</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <img src="sfphi.png" alt="Giants vs Phillies moneyline pick for July 8" style="box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(255,215,0,0.3); width:100%; max-width:750px;"/>
            <p>We are heading to Oracle Park tonight where the San Francisco Giants host the Phillies in a matchup that feels like a clear lean toward the home team. Robbie Ray has been sharp since returning, with a 2.69 ERA and a dominant strikeout-to-walk ratio. His numbers at home have been even better, limiting opponents to a sub-.200 batting average.</p>
            <p>Taijuan Walker takes the mound for Philly with a respectable 3.65 ERA, but he's been inconsistent on the road and has struggled at times to keep the ball in the yard. The Giants lineup is far from an elite, but they've been trending up, especially against right-handed pitching at home.</p>
            <p>The market opened with the Giants as moderate favorites and quickly ticked toward -150. This is a sign of smart action aligning with the better pitcher and stronger recent form. San Francisco has been solid at home all season, posting a 26–17 record at Oracle, while Philly comes in just 23–22 on the road.</p>
            <p>There is also a bullpen advantage here. The Giants' relief corps has been stingy in the second half, ranking top 5 in ERA since June 1. If Ray can get through six clean innings, San Francisco is well equipped to close the door late.</p>
            <p>We are locking in Giants Moneyline -150 as today's official pick.</p>
